# Classic Fantasy Imperative System Resource Document

Version 1.0, September 2023

Classic Fantasy Imperative is an Open, ORC Licensed, version of the Mythras ruleset, focusing on dungeon exploration, high adventure, and tense encounters involving treasure, magic, and deadly foes. Classic Fantasy Imperative emulates the original thrill of the very first roleplaying game in the hobby but approaches it through the lens of the Mythras game system, which is 1d100 (or percentile) based, rather than using a d20.

This document offers a comprehensive, but not exhaustive, set of rules, including character creation, character races and classes, skills, rules for certain typical situations, combat, and magic – more than enough to get both players and Games Masters started, and form a solid basis for further development. _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ is completely compatible with _Classic Fantasy Imperative_, the _Mythras_ core rules, and Mythras Imperative. Plus, it is also compatible with other ORC licensed percentile gaming systems.

## New to d100?

_Classic Fantasy Imperative_ is a d100 or percentile system. Percentile dice, or 1d100, are used to resolve key actions – skill use, combat, magic casting, and so on. It is a roll-under system, meaning that the target number is expressed as a percentage (Athletics 65%, for instance), and both the Games Master and player are looking to roll equal to or less than this target number, using 1d100, to achieve a Success. It is quite easy to replace the 1d100 with a d20 if preferred, and all percentages can be divided by 5 (round up) to gain the target number for a d20 roll. Athletics 65% would become Athletics 13, in our example. However, 1d100 offers a great deal of flexibility and nuance that underpins the whole game, so our recommendation is to try the 1d100 approach first. While it may seem counterintuitive to have to roll _less_ than something (in many games, higher is usually better!), having a target number expressed as a percentage range that one needs to roll _within_ makes it easy and simple to see your chances of success, and allows for quite a few 'dice tricks,' such as Opposed Rolls, Criticals, and Fumbles, and a few other things explored later in these rules. Percentile roleplaying has been around for a long time and is a firmly established game system with a tried and tested core mechanic that is flexible, intuitive, and tends to fade into the background during play.

## Simplification

Long time owners of _Mythras_ and _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ will note that in some places the _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ rules have been simplified. This has been done so that a Games Master may more quickly introduce the game to new players with a minimum of fuss. Another area where _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ differs is in incorporating Imperial measurements instead of metric. Incorporating both takes up far too much room and would require multiple tables when dealing with Ranged Weapons and the like. The Imperial system was chosen simply to facilitate easier use of the countless battle mats already in existence, and to make converting adventures from other game systems that use Imperial measurements simpler. When filling out your Character Sheet, feel free to use the Conversion Tables in the Appendix, and whatever measurement system you find most useful and familiar.

## Rounding of Numbers and Results

On some occasions you will be required to divide numbers - typically the rating in a skill (such as for determining a Critical Success, which is 1/10th of the skill's value). Whenever a division result creates a fraction, always round up to the whole number. So, for instance, 1/10th of 64% is 6.4; this is rounded up to 7.

## Dice Used in the Game

_Classic Fantasy Imperative_ uses the standard polyhedral dice set: d4, d6, d8, d10 d12, d20 and d100. Additionally, the following dice are call for:

**d2:** Roll any die. An odds number equals 1 and evens equals 2. Or flip a coin.

**d3:** Roll a six-sided die; 1-2 = 1, 3-4 = 2, 5-6 = 3.

# Chapter 1: Characters

The basic character is defined by a series of different elements that describe the character's capabilities. These elements are:

- Characteristics: such as Strength or Charisma
- Attributes: things like Height or Movement
- Skills: expertise in fundamental abilities

Most of these elements are described in terms of numbers, and some are dependent on or calculated by others. What each element means, and how they are determined, is described in the following sections.

## Step 1: Character Concept

A good place to start is to have some idea of what sort of character you want to play; a hardened fighter for example, or a cunning rogue. Your character concept does not need to be elaborate at this stage; simply an idea that will help guide certain choices such as Race and Class. A few character ideas are listed to provoke your imagination.

Young, naïve magic-user

Bad-tempered half-orc fighter

Overconfident halfling rogue

Pious dwarf cleric

## Step 2: Characteristics

Everyone is defined by seven Characteristics which tell you something about your character; how strong or fast they are; how clever or healthy. Characteristics are at the core of every _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ character and form the basis for most of the other elements such as Attributes and Skills. The seven Characteristics are:

- Strength (STR)
- Constitution (CON)
- Size (SIZ)
- Dexterity (DEX)
- Intelligence (INT)
- Power (POW)
- Charisma (CHA)

Before calculating the Characteristics, the following section explains what each represents.

#### Strength (STR)

STR represents physical strength: how much one can lift, how hard one can hit, and so on. STR is a component of the Damage Modifier (page XX). If a character is reduced to zero STR they lack the ability to move or lift objects.

#### Constitution (CON)

CON is a measure of health and hardiness. CON is a component in determining Hit Points (see page XX) and Healing Rate (see page XX). If CON falls to zero for any reason the character dies.

#### Size (SIZ)

SIZ measures mass and helps indicate Height and Weight. SIZ is used to help figure Hit Points (see page XX), as larger, heavier creatures tend to have greater endurance against damage. SIZ can also be used to determine a character's Damage Modifier, since mass helps to increase the force of a blow.

#### Dexterity (DEX)

Agility, balance, and reflexes are measured by DEX. It is an important aspect of Initiative (see page XX). If a character is reduced to zero DEX, they suffer functional paralysis.

#### Intelligence (INT)

INT is a measurement of cognitive ability. Those with a lower INT score are not necessarily stupid, but they are likely to be constrained in how creatively they can employ their wits. INT is a factor in calculating Initiative. If INT is reduced to zero, the character becomes completely mindless.

#### Power (POW)

POW is a measurement of a character's soul, spirit, inner drive, or capacity for magic. POW governs a character's Magic Points and Luck Points (see page XX). If a character's POW ever drops to zero, they lose all independent will.

#### Charisma (CHA)

Charisma measures personality and is independent of physical appearance. CHA affects a character's Experience Modifier (see page XX). If CHA ever falls to zero, the character can no longer socially interact with others, becoming so painfully shy or antisocial they are ignored or even driven away.

### Calculating Characteristics

Each Characteristic has a numerical value to determine how potent it is.The number in parentheses after each dice score is the racial average and is used as a gauge to rate your character's results when compared to other members of their species. Suggestions for determining your Characteristics include:

**Dice Roll:** Roll the dice indicated in the Racial Characteristics Table for STR, CON, SIZ, DEX, INT, POW, and CHA taking each rolled score as it comes. Since the results of these rolls can be somewhat random, it is often better to decide on a character concept after the dice are rolled. Otherwise, the final Characteristics may preclude a preconceived role. Roll 3d6 for STR, CON, DEX, POW, and CHA; then 2d6+6 for SIZ and INT.

**Dice Roll, Assign** : As above, except the player may exchange values between Characteristics with the same dice range. For example, when rolling up a human, the player could swap values among STR, CON, DEX, POW, and CHA, as they share a 3d6 range, or between SIZ and INT, which share the 2d6+6 range —but they must always be from the same dice range group; you cannot switch rolls from one group to the other.

**Dice Roll, High:** Roll one extra die as indicated for STR, CON, SIZ, DEX, INT, POW, and CHA, and drop the lowest result from each.

**Points Build** : Instead of rolling dice to determine Characteristics, players build their character from a preset pool of points, the amount of which is determined by the character's species. This method is best for groups that know what they want to play and want to tailor their build to a specific Class.

Certain rules apply to the Points Build option:

- Begin with the racial average for each of the seven Characteristics as noted in parentheses after each dice range below.
- Spend another 10 points (humans) or 6 points (demi-humans) to increase Characteristics.
- You may also lower a Characteristic to gain extra points. For example, reduce STR 11 to 9 to gain 2 points.
- Characteristics cannot be _lower_ than the minimum possible or _greater_ than maximum possible for that Characteristic as determined by its potential dice roll.

Games Masters are free to come up with their own methods or point values as desired.

The following table summarizes the information needed for each of the above methods. The dice ranges are used in either of the Dice Roll methods, while numbers in parentheses are used in Points Build.

##### Racial Characteristics Table

| _Race_ | _ **Dwarf** _ | _ **Elf** _ | _ **Gnome** _ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _STR_ | 2d6+9 (16) | 2d6+4 (11) | 2d6+1 (8) |
| _CON_ | 2d6+9 (16) | 3d6 (11) | 2d6+6 (13) |
| _SIZ_ | 2d4+4 (9) | 2d6+4 (11) | 1d3+2 (4) |
| _DEX_ | 3d6 (11) | 2d6+9 (16) | 3d6+2 (13) |
| _INT_ | 2d6+6 (13) | 2d6+7 (14) | 2d6+8 (15) |
| _POW_ | 3d6 (11) | 2d6+7 (14) | 2d6+7 (14) |
| _CHA_ | 2d6+2 (9) | 3d6 (11) | 3d6 (11) |

| _Race_ | _Half-Elf_ | _Half-Orc_ | _Halfling_ | _Human_ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _STR_ | 3d6 (11) | 2d6+9 (16) | 2d6+1 (8) | 3d6 (11) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _CON_ | 3d6 (11) | 2d6+6 (13) | 2d6+7 (14) | 3d6 (11) |
| _SIZ_ | 2d6+6 (13) | 2d6+9 (16) | 1d4+5 (8) | 2d6+6 (13) |
| _DEX_ | 2d6+6 (13) | 3d6 (11) | 3d6+3 (14) | 3d6 (11) |
| _INT_ | 2d6+6 (13) | 2d6+5 (12) | 2d6+6 (13) | 2d6+6 (13) |
| _POW_ | 2d6+6 (13) | 3d6 (11) | 2d6+9 (16) | 3d6 (11) |
| _CHA_ | 3d6 (11) | 2d6+1 (8) | 2d6+5 (12) | 3d6 (11) |

## Step 3: Attributes

Each character also has a set of attributes. These are capabilities derived from the Characteristics or determined by them that are used to govern certain factors of game play.

#### Action Points

How often a character can act in a Combat Round (page XX) is determined by Action Points. Starting characters begin with 2 Action Points but gain more as they rise in Rank. See the relevant Class Advancement Tables for details.

#### Damage Modifier

The bonus amount of damage a character inflicts when they physically strike or apply force. It is generally used in combat situations but can also be utilized when attempting to break objects. The Damage Modifier is an extra die roll which is either added to, or subtracted from, the damage inflicted by the weapon or tool. If a negative Damage Modifier takes a weapon's damage to zero or below, then no damage at all has been inflicted.

Add together STR and SIZ and consult the Damage Modifier table:

##### Damage Modifier Table

| _STR+SIZ_ | _Damage Modifier_ |
| --- | --- |
| _5 or less_ | –1d8 |
| --- | --- |
| _6–10_ | –1d6 |
| _11–15_ | –1d4 |
| _16–20_ | –1d2 |
| _21–25_ | +0 |
| _26–30_ | +1d2 |
| _31–35_ | +1d4 |
| _36–40_ | +1d6 |
| _41–45_ | +1d8 |
| _46–50_ | +1d10 |
| _51–60_ | +1d12 |
| _61–70_ | +2d6 |
| _71–80_ | +1d8+1d6 |
| _81–90_ | +2d8 |
| _91–100_ | +1d10+1d8 |
| _101–110_ | +2d10 |
| _111–120_ | +2d10+1d2 |
| _121–130_ | +2d10+1d4 |
| _Each 10 points_ | Continue Progression |

#### Experience Modifier

Over the course of play characters improve their skills and capabilities. This is achieved using Experience Rolls which are explained in more detail on page XX.

A character's CHA score may adjust the number of Experience Rolls the character has, reflecting the relationship they have with their peers and their reputation in the community. If CHA is high people are willing to put themselves out to help train or support the character while they undergo tuition. Conversely, if CHA is particularly low, there may be some difficulty improving one's capabilities without the assistance of others; finding someone to spar against for example.

##### Experience Modifier Table

| _CHA_ | _Exp. Modifier_ |
| --- | --- |
| _6 or less_ | -1 |
| --- | --- |
| _7-12_ | +0 |
| _13-18_ | +1 |
| _Each 6 points_ | +1 |

#### Healing Rate

After receiving injuries, a character needs to recuperate. Healing Rate determines how quickly they naturally recover from wounds. Depending on the severity of the injury (see page XX), the Healing Rate denotes how many Hit Points are recovered per day, week, or month.

##### Healing Rate Table

| _CON_ | _Healing Rate_ |
| --- | --- |
| _6 or less_ | 1 |
| --- | --- |
| _7-12_ | 2 |
| _13-18_ | 3 |
| _Each 6 points_ | +1 |

#### Initiative

The moment at which someone reacts in combat is governed by Initiative. Initiative acts as a modifier to Initiative rolls; the higher the Initiative, the faster one responds in a combat situation, determining when you can act. Further factors – armor for example – modify it. The Combat chapter goes into more detail on how Initiative is used (see page XX).

Initiative is the average of the DEX and INT Characteristics.

#### Luck Points

Luck Points represent that strange force differentiating adventuring heroes from everyday folk. Call it fate, karma, or simple good fortune. Luck Points can be used to:

- Re-roll the dice if they are unfavorable.
- Mitigate physical damage or other unfortunate circumstances.
- Gain an edge at a vital moment in combat.

Exactly how they are used, and when, is described on page XX. Once a Luck Point is spent, the pool decreases; when one is out of Luck Points, no more are available – unless the Games Master makes an impromptu award – until the next game session when they replenish to their normal value.

##### Luck Points Table

| _POW_ | _Luck Points_ |
| --- | --- |
| _6 or less_ | 1 |
| _7-12_ | 2 |
| _13-18_ | 3 |
| _Each 6 points_ | +1 |

\* Humans start with one additional Luck Point over and above that shown above.

\*\* All characters gain an additional Luck Point as each new Rank is attained.

#### Magic Points

Mystical abilities and spells cast in _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ usually rely on Magic Points. Since the availability of magic may be limited by a campaign setting or to specific magical professions, some characters will find this Attribute superfluous.

For those who can utilize such powers, a character's Magic Points are equal to their POW. These points are used to cast spells, the cost of which is dependent on the type of magic used. When casters run out of Magic Points they have exhausted their ability to cast any spells until Magic Points are replenished.

#### Movement Rate

Every creature has a Movement Rate – several feet that can be traveled during a specific period. Movement is not calculated from Characteristics but is a default value which differs from species to species. The Base Movement Rate for humans is 20 feet, although certain skills can improve this. The section on Movement, on page XX offers more detail.

##### Movement Rate by Race Table

| _Species_ | _Feet_ | _Metres_ |
 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _Dwarf_ | 15 | 4.5 |
 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _Elf_ | 20 | 6 |
 |
| _Gnome_ | 15 | 4.5 |
 |
| _Half-Elf_ | 20 | 6 |
 |
| _Half-Orc_ | 20 | 6 |
 |
| _Halfling_ | 15 | 4.5 |
 |
| _Human_ | 20 | 6 |
 |

#### Hit Points

Hit Points represent how much injury an area of the body can withstand before it becomes useless, possibly resulting in incapacitation and ultimately the character's death. The body of every creature is divided into separate locations – humans, for example, have seven; the head, chest, abdomen, arms, and legs – each location with its own Hit Points.

Some creatures, such as monsters or different classes of animal, by their very nature often have radically different body structures, yet each location they possess still has Hit Points. When a location's Hit Points are reduced to a certain level through damage of any kind, then the character suffers certain consequences that reflect the severity of the injury. For further information concerning wounds see page XX.

To calculate the Hit Points of each location, add CON and SIZ together and cross-reference the result on the Hit Points table. All characters gain 1 additional Hit Point in each location at Rank 2 and 4.

##### Hit Points per Location Table

| _Location_ | _CON+SIZ_ |
| --- | --- |
| 1–5 | 6–10 | 11–15 | 16–20 | 21–25 | 26–30 | 31–35 | 36–40 | +5 |
| _Head_ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | +1 |
| _Chest_ | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | +1 |
| _Abdomen_ | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | +1 |
| _Each Arm_ | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | +1 |
| _Each Leg_ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | +1 |

## Step 4: Skills

By default, every character has a range of Standard Skills allowing him to perform a variety of actions with varying degrees of expertise. These skills are detailed more fully in the Skills chapter but cover a range of everyday activities and local knowledge which anyone can use without specialized training. At this point of character creation, players will only need to know the Base Levels of each Standard Skill.

The basic score of each Standard Skill is determined by the sum of two Characteristics or a multiple of a single Characteristic. The value represents the character's innate competence in each area, in effect their raw talent before any formative training received as part of his culture and profession.

The Standard Skills Table shows how the basic values are calculated, along with a brief description of what the skill is and does. The score represents the percentage chance of success for a skill; so, an Athletics score of 25 is expressed as 25%. How skill percentages work and more detailed skill descriptions are provided in the Skills chapter.

Note that the basic percentages for some skills will be modified by both culture and profession, so these starting values will change as character creation progresses.

##### Standard Skills Table

| _Skill_ | _Basic Percentage_ |
| --- | --- |
| _Athletics_ | STR+DEX |
| --- | --- |
| _Boating_ | STR+CON |
| _Brawn_ | STR+SIZ |
| _Conceal_ | DEX+POW |
| _Customs_ | INT x2, +40\* |
| _Dance_ | DEX+CHA |
| _Deceit_ | INT+CHA |
| _Drive_ | DEX+POW |
| _Endurance_ | CON x2 |
| _Evade_ | DEX x2 |
| _First Aid_ | INT+DEX |
| _Influence_ | CHA x2 |
| _Insight_ | INT+POW |
| _Locale_ | INT x2 |
| _Native Tongue_ | INT+CHA, +40\* |
| _Perception_ | INT+POW |
| _Ride_ | DEX+POW |
| _Sing_ | CHA+POW |
| _Stealth_ | DEX+INT |
| _Swim_ | STR+CON |
| _Unarmed_ | STR+DEX |
| _Willpower_ | POW x2 |

\* Includes a static bonus of +40% for both Customs and the character's Native Tongue (Common for humans). Each demi-human race may speak the Common Tongue at +40%, in addition to their Native Tongue at +40%, as detailed in their respective write-ups.

## Step 5: Race/Culture

In _Classic Fantasy Imperative_, players may typically choose from one of six races for their characters: Human, or one of the demi-human races (Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, or Halfling). If human, they must further define their character through one of three cultural backgrounds; Barbarian, Civilized, and Nomadic. For humans. culture determines the kind of society in which the character was raised, and so prescribes certain outlooks and philosophies they might have. More practically, culture helps define the values of the various skills that shape your character's overall capabilities. The demi-human races generally come from a racial culture which is much more stereotypical of the race in general. See the Race/Culture write-ups in chapter 2 for more information.

All characters have an Alignment, which consists of one Ethical and one Moral Code, as well as two or three Passions. Some will have an Oath to a religious order, guild, or organization. Each Class write-up notes any required Alignment or Oaths. Before continuing, look up your race in chapter 2 and note the suggested Alignment and Passions, and your Class in chapter 3 and see if there are any Alignment or Oath requirements. See Chapter 4 to determine any specifics regarding your Alignment, Passions, and Oaths, if any.

Each race and culture lists a variety of Standard Skills that the character learns as part of his formative development within that society. These are core abilities which all characters from the same specific culture improve to some degree. Characters also learn a few specialized or esoteric Professional Skills according to their personal interests.

Professional Skills are further explained in Chapter 5, but in brief they represent those skills which cannot be attempted without years of rigorous study and specialized training. Whereas a character has a basic ability in all Standard Skills, they have zero ability in any Professional Skill unless chosen as part of their cultural upbringing or Class.

Chosen Professional Skills start off at their Base Level Characteristic value as per Standard Skills. Some Professional Skills such as Craft, Languages, or Lores offer choice of a specialization. In these cases, the specialty chosen should be one which suits that culture.

#### Racial Skill Quick Picks

Quick Picks provide an average selection of skills, enabling quick character creation. Feel free to swap points, if desired; however, no skill can have fewer than a +5 or more than a +15 bonus.

\* Humans are not limited in the selection of languages during character creation if they can justify the choice.

\*\* During character creation, additional languages are limited to gnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin, orc, and gnoll.

**Racial Skill Point Buy**

Optionally, you may spend points to customize a specific character concept. This allows for a more tailored character at the expense of time. When applying Skills perform the following steps:

- Select three Professional Skills from the options offered (See race write-ups in Chapter XX).
- Distribute 100 points among the listed Standard Skills and chosen Professional Skills, increasing that skill by 1% for every point spent on improving it. Players are free to choose how much each skill is improved by, but each skill must receive a minimum of 5% and cannot receive more than 15%.

## Step 6: Class

Class represents the career the character has embarked on as part of the transition to adulthood, and it further defines the character's skill development.

Players are normally free to choose which Class they wish their character to play assuming that the Games Master deems it suitable. The Class write-upsgive some guidance as to the common Classes available to each racial/cultural type. This should be seen as common representations, and not restrictions. Players should feel free to play as any Class/Race combination that best fits their vision.

Like Race/Cultural backgrounds, each Class offers the chance to improve a range of Standard and Professional Skills commonly used by that occupation. Unlike cultural backgrounds, characters need not invest their points in every available skill but may tailor which ones are taken as those fitting for their specific role or Culture.

#### Class Skill Quick Picks

Choose a Class Quick Pick for an average selection of skills useful to the Class in question. Feel free to swap points, if desired; however, while the skill can be reduced to a +0, functioning at Base Level (including Professional Skills), no skill can have more than a +15 bonus. These skills already include any Class Skill Bonuses from Abilities.

##### Class Quick Picks Table

| _Class_ | _Standard Skills_ | _Professional Skills_ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _Cleric_ | Combat Skill (Cleric) +15; First Aid +5; Influence +5; Insight +10; Willpower +15 | Channel +15; Courtesy +10; Devotion (deity) +15; Lore (Religion) +5 and one of the following at +5: Language (any), Lore (any), or Oratory |
| _Fighter_ | Athletics +10; Boating or Ride +5; Brawn +15; Combat Skill (Fighter) +20\*\*; Endurance +15; Evade +10; Unarmed +15\*\* | Intimidation +10; and two of the following at +5: Gambling, Survival or Navigation |
| _Magic-User_ | Evade +10; First Aid +5; Influence +5; Insight +5; Locale +5; Perception +5; Willpower +15 | Arcane Casting +15; Arcane Knowledge +15; Language (any) +5; Language (any) or Lore (any) +5; Lore (Alchemy) +10 |
| _Rogue_ | Athletics +15; Combat Skill (Rogue) +10; Deceit +5; Evade +15; Insight +5; Perception +5; Stealth +15 | Language (Thieves' Cant) +40\*\*\*; Lockpicking +10; Mechanisms +10; and two of the following at +5: Acrobatics, Acting, Commerce, Disguise, Intimidation, Seduction, Slight, or Streetwise |

\* Acquired at the Base Level.

\*\* Includes a +5 Combat Proficiency bonus.

\*\*\* Acquired at the Base Level, +40% bonus applied.

#### Class Skill Point Buy

Optionally, you may spend points to customize a specific character concept. As above, this allows for a more tailored character at the expense of time. Characters using this method, develop their Class skills in the following way:

- Select up to 3 skills from the Professional Skills available to that Class.
- Distribute 100 points among the Class's listed Standard Skills and whatever Professional Skills were chosen, increasing each skill by 1% for every point spent on improving it. Not all the available skills need to be improved, but no individual skill can receive more than a 15% increase. Some Classes grant more than 3 Professional Skills, but never more points.
- All Classes include a Combat Skill that encompasses the weapons that Class is typically trained in the use of. This may be as few as 4 or 5 simple weapons as in the case of the magic-user, to all weapons and shields as in the case of the fighter. Where Combat Skill is included in the list of Standard Skills, it is treated as such and may be improved with Class Skill Points. Where Combat Skill is omitted, as is the case of the magic-user, it may only be improved using Bonus Skill Points during Step 7 of character creation.

Newly chosen Professional Skills and the Class Combat Skill start at their Base Level Characteristic value. Choosing a Professional Skill previously gained via cultural background simply allows the character to further apply some of their Class Skill Points at this stage. Some of these skills, such as Craft, Language, or Lore, offer the choice of a specialization. In these cases, the specialty selected should be one that suits the character's culture.

Certain Classes may have either more skills to choose from or may choose more skills than others. This is balanced by the fact that all characters are still built with the same 100 points. So, a character with more skills will end up having to spread their points more thinly knowing a little about a lot, and a character that has fewer skills to choose from will end up being more specialized.

#### A Note on Class Abilities and Rank

Keep in mind that all Classes require a skill level of at least _ **40% in any five Class skills** _ to utilize that Class's special Abilities or to cast spells. You are considered competent in a skill at 50% or higher. So, to qualify for Rank 1, the character must possess any five Class skills at 40% or higher. Rank 2 requires any five Class skills at 70%, Rank 3 requires any four Class skills at 90%, and so on.

A character may choose to start at Rank 0 if they do not have sufficient skill levels and attain Rank 1 in play if they desire, but to be able to use or cast spells, these prerequisites must be met.

#### Combat Skill (STR+DEX)

Combat Skill is the skill relating to fighting and the use of weapons. It is a diverse skill with many specializations related to the pertaining character Class. Most fighting traditions encompass training in multiple weapons of the same type, along with the techniques required to use them all effectively. Therefore, Combat Skill is an umbrella that melds together many related aspects of fighting under a single ability, removing the need to purchase multiple sub-skills.

Combat Skill has a Basic Percentage equal to STR+DEX.

Since most people can pick up a weapon and instinctively either swing, throw, or fire it, Combat Skill is considered a Standard Skill. Yet due to their potentially diverse nature, they are categorized and defined separately.

All characters learn their Combat Skill as part of their chosen Class, as described in Chapter 3.

## Step 7: Bonus Skill Points

At this stage, every character gains an additional pool of 'free' Skill Points based on Experience Level, which can be distributed among existing skills. These are provided to round out the character, adding interests or areas of expertise. The default for fresh beginning characters is a pool of 100 points, with a limit of assigning no more than 10 points per skill. If characters are more experienced, then the number of Skill Points and restrictions will differ, as indicated on the Experience Table.

Bonus Skill Points are used in the following ways:

- Allow the character the option of choosing one final new Professional Skill for free, reflecting a personal hobby or interest.
- Alternately, the character may add a new weapon type to their Combat Skill.
- Either add a +10 bonus to ten different skills, or distribute points among them, increasing each skill by 1% for every point spent on improving it. No individual skill can receive more points than indicated by their Experience Level. If you choose a new Professional Skill, you must add points to it.
- Save for the optional hobby specialty, no points may be assigned to Professional Skills not learned as part of their culture or Class.

#### Creating Experienced Characters

It is recommended that beginning characters start fresh, at Rank 1, with little or no practical experience. Of course, the level of the characters will depend greatly on the setting and whether the game will be a short one-off adventure or a long-running campaign. It is also common for a player to create a more experienced character if replacing one that has died in play or when joining an existing campaign.

A table is provided, breaking experience into Experience Categories. A character's Experience has a direct correlation to age and skill competence; more experienced characters naturally have more life experience than their younger compatriots. However, the noted Age Bonus should be treated as approximate, as campaigns advance at different rates — some campaigns have lots of game time pass between adventures while others are one long string of unbroken adventures. When converting an existing character, simply substitute the actual age for that noted below.

This table may also be used for NPCs, whether built using a Class or a career, and follows the same rules. There is one exception: Non-Player Characters built as part of a career have no special Abilities, including the extra Luck Points, which are reserved for player characters and significant Non-Player Characters only. Note that a starting NPC built as a career is Rank 1 by default.

##### Experience Table

| _Rank (Level\*)_ | _Age_ | _Bonus Skill Points_ | _Maximum Skill Increase_ | _Average Skill Level\*\*_ | _Advancement_ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _Rank 1: Fresh (1-4)_ | By species | 100 | +10 | 40-60 | Any 5 Class Skills at 40% |
| _Rank 2: Low Level (5-9)_ | +1d6 | 300 | +30 | 65-75 | Any 5 Class Skills at 70% |
| _Rank 3: Mid. Level (10-14)_ | +1d6+5 | 500 | +50 | 85-95 | Any 4 Class Skills at 90% |
| _Rank 4: High Level (15-19)_ | +1d6+10 | 700 | +70 | 105-115 | Any 3 Class Skills at 110% |
| _Rank 5: Epic Level (20+)_ | +1d6+20 | 900 | +90 | 125-135 | Any 2 Class Skills at 130% |

\* The number in parentheses may be used as a gauge when converting existing characters from Level-Based games.

\*\* This is the average skill level of any skills of particular importance to the Class in question.

**Experience Table Notes**

- Rank is a rough descriptive guide to compare characters of differing skill levels.
- Age is determined by calculating age according to species and adding any noted bonus. It is more of a guideline than a hard and fast rule, as time passes differently from campaign to campaign.
- Bonus Skill Points determine how many points the character must spend on developing skills. This is NOT cumulative with those of previous ranks. For example, a Rank 2 character is built with 300 points, not 300 points, plus the 100 from Rank 1.
- Maximum Skill Increase limits how many of the Bonus Points can be applied to any one Skill.
- Average Skill Level shows the typical range for a character's most important Class-related skills at each Experience Level. It is included for reference purposes and assumes Base Level Characteristics of 16, with maximum Skill Points spent during each step. Actual results will vary.
- Advancement: This represents the number of Class Skills required to attain the noted Rank. For example, to attain Rank 3, any four of the Class Skills noted in the relevant Class write-up must be at least 90%.

## Step 8: Finally…

- Determine your Alignment and Passions based on your chosen Culture/Race and Class. See chapter 4.
- Note any Starting Abilities from your Race and Class.
- Under Ranked Abilities, choose one Rank 1 Class Ability that you meet the requirements for at no cost in EXP rolls.
- Copy down starting equipment as noted at the end of your Class write-up.
- Do not forget to give your character a name. Also, look for ways to establish connections with other characters if desired.

# Chapter 2: Culture & Races

A description of each racial background follows incorporating a list of appropriate skill bonuses. Players choosing a human character need to further define their character with an appropriate culture. Players should apply the skill bonuses immediately to the Standard Skills on their Character Sheet and add the additional new skills, known as Professional Skills (introduced in the next chapter), to the appropriate section of the sheet. In many cases a race lists a range of skills and invites the player to pick one or more, that will gain a bonus: in this way players from identical racial backgrounds can ensure that their adventurers are different in the areas they have developed.

Also note that each race comes with an average Alignment and several Passions (See Chapter 4: Alignment and Passions). Alignment and Passions can add a great deal of depth and characterization to the adventurer you are creating, defining ingrained preferences and prejudices as well as defining the character's moral values.

## Humans

Humans can inhabit just about any location in a fantasy world and can have contact with any and every species at one point or another. Some of the demi-human and humanoid races look upon humans as their staunchest of allies; others view them as the most vindictive of enemies. They can reach ages close to 100 years, sometimes even exceeding it, though rarely naturally. Humans tend to be fast learners and are more adaptive to change than any of the other races. Many believe that humans are the chosen race of the gods, a belief that is not without some merit, as the demi-human races seem to be on the decline in comparison to humans. Of course, some demi-human races attribute this to the voracious nature of human expansion.

### Human Culture

Of all the playable races, only humans choose a separate culture, which helps them to further define themselves. Note that each culture can be even more granular and can be altered to be very much region-specific. Demi-humans in comparison are less widespread, and as a result, their culture is more homogeneous and entirely subsumed under their race. The following information details the four types of human cultures.

#### Barbarian

Tribal in nature, barbarians tend to shun civilization, viewing those who live in large towns and cities as weak and corrupt. Although their own settlements are also sedentary, they tend to be far smaller and closer to nature. Barbarian tribes occupy distinct territories, often half tamed wilderness, which they regard as their own for hunting, grazing, and farming purposes. Most are adept in the use of weaponry as they must overcome many dangers throughout their lives – facing creatures of the wilds or mustering to defend their lands against rival tribes. Since they live in small communities the ties of kinship and clan are strong elements of their society.

**Skills**

**Free Skills:** Customs +40, Language (Common) +40

**Standard Skills:** Athletics, Brawn, Endurance, First Aid, Locale, Perception; and either Boating or Ride

**Professional Skills:** Craft. (any), Healing, Language (Any\*), Lore (any), Musicianship, Navigate, Seamanship, Survival, Track

\* Humans are not limited in selection of languages during character creation if they can justify the choice.

**Cultural Passions**

**Alignment:** Any, choose one or two from an Ethical Code (Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic), and one or two from a Moral Code (Good, Neutral, or Evil). Alternately, choose one or two from True Neutral.

**Other Passion:** Any, but typically one or two from the following:

- Loyalty to Clan Chieftain
- Love (friend, sibling, or romantic lover)
- Hate (magic, creature, rival, or clan)

##### Special Rules

**Movement:** 20 feet.

**Survival Bonus (Specific):** Barbarians find all Survival rolls pertaining to their area of origin one grade easier.

**Exposure Tolerance:** Barbarians suffer reduced effects from exposure to temperature extremes related to their area of origin. For example, if originating from cold climates, even lightly outfitted barbarians would be permitted a grace period equal to their CON in hours before exposure sets in. Wearing suitable clothing would extend this to double their CON in hours. After this point they need to seek shelter or start to suffer Fatigue loss. See the Weather Tables on page XX for additional information.

**Illiterate:** Barbarians are typically unable to read or write. They may learn literacy by spending 1 Experience Roll and a month of training under a character literate in the desired language. This gives them basic literacy equal to half skill level in one language the character knows. If desired, another 1 Experience Roll and a month of training will give them full literacy. When learning new languages in play, it can be assumed they are learning them at full literacy level.

**Lucky:** Humans start with one additional Luck Point.

#### Civilized

The Civilized culture is epitomized by a semblance of law and order, underpinned by complex social codes, and supported by a bureaucracy. Civilized people believe themselves superior to all other cultures because their achievements tend toward permanence: sprawling cities, imposing temples, celebratory monuments, and the recording of history and events in books, tomes, and scrolls. Of course, this is a thin veneer. The most Civilized of cities can be more lawless than any Barbarian frontier settlement; and the social codes may be cruder than the hospitality rituals of nomads. But the Civilized culture prides itself on its achievements, its infrastructure, its professional artisans, and its ability to easily extend its reach to wherever it wishes to go.

**Movement:** 20 feet.

**Literate:** Those from Civilized regions are typically able to read and write any language they can speak.

**Lucky:** Humans start with one additional Luck Point.

#### Nomadic

Nomadic people are constantly on the move, with no home and hearth to call their own. They may wander aimlessly about or might have several camps they move to and from throughout the year. They raise few crops and instead follow the migrations of animals or fish, perhaps even herding their own domesticated beasts. Nomads are adept at subsisting on what they can quickly and easily scavenge from their surroundings, letting nothing go to waste. The skills of the nomad culture should be tailored to their environment. Some journey vast distances on foot, others live in caravans or ride strange creatures, and some drift. across the oceans on great floating rafts.

**Skills**

**Free Skills:** Customs +40, Language (Common) +40.

**Standard Skills:** Endurance, First Aid, Locale, Perception, Stealth; and two of the following: Athletics, Boating, Swim, Drive or Ride depending on the primary mode of travel.

**Professional Skills:** Craft. (any), Culture (any), Healing, Language (any\*), Lore (any), Musicianship, Navigate, Survival, Track.

\* Humans are not limited in selection of languages during character creation if they can justify the choice.

**Cultural Passions**

**Alignment:** Any, choose one or two from an Ethical Code (Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic), and one or two from a Moral Code (Good, Neutral, or Evil). Alternately, choose one or two from True Neutral.

**Passion:** Any, but typically one or two from the following:

- Loyalty to Tribal Chieftain/Khan
- Love (friend, sibling, or romantic lover)
- Hate (creature, rival, or tribe)

##### Special Rules

**Movement:** 20 feet.

**Survival Bonus (Specific):** Nomads find all Survival rolls pertaining to their area of origin one grade easier.

**Literate:** Because they interact with many other races and cultures, those from Nomadic cultures are typically able to read and write any language they can speak.

**Lucky:** Humans start with one additional Luck Point.

#### Primitive

Of all peoples, primitives are those that live closest with the land, in tune with its hidden secrets. Living in extended family groups, primitive cultures gather around very simple dwellings that can range from caves and areas of natural shelter through to lean-tos or very basic huts. Primitives are typically hunter-gatherers with either few, or poorly developed, systems for farming and husbandry.

However, certain cultural beliefs, often based on superstitions, can be very well defined. Few primitive cultures have developed anything approaching a written language although paintings and other pictorial symbols serve as a means of communication.

**Skills**

**Free Skills:** Customs +40, Language (Common) +40.

**Standard Skills:** Brawn, Endurance, Evade, Locale, Perception, Stealth; and one of either Athletics, Boating, First Aid, or Swim.

**Professional Skills:** Craft. (any), Healing, Lore (any), Language (any\*), Musicianship, Navigate, Survival, Track.

\* Humans are not limited in selection of languages during character creation if they can justify the choice.

**Note:** Primitives are illiterate and do not automatically know how to read or write. They may learn literacy by spending 1 Experience Roll and a month of training under a character literate in the desired language. This gives them basic literacy equal to half skill level in one language the character knows. If desired, another 1 Experience Roll and a month of training will give them full literacy. When learning new languages in play, it can be assumed they are learning them at full literacy level.

**Cultural Passions**

**Alignment:** Any, choose one or two from an Ethical Code (Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic), and one or two from a Moral Code (Good, Neutral, or Evil). Alternately, choose one or two from True Neutral.

**Passion:** Any, but typically one or two from the following:

- Loyalty to Chief/Headman
- Love (friend, sibling, or romantic lover)
- Hate (something that scares or intimidates you)

##### Special Rules

**Movement:** 20 feet.

**Survival Bonus (Specific):** Primitive cultures find all Survival rolls pertaining to their area of origin one grade easier.

**Illiterate:** Nomads are typically unable to read or write. They may learn literacy by spending 1 Experience Roll and a month of training under a character literate in the desired language. This gives them basic literacy equal to half skill level in one language the character knows. If desired, another 1 Experience Roll and a month of training will give them full literacy. When learning new languages in play, it can be assumed they are learning them at full literacy level.

**Lucky:** Humans start with one additional Luck Point.

## Demi-Human Races

Demi-human characters are created in almost the same way as humans. Characteristics are determined using the Characteristic dice for that species, which will result in different Characteristic values and ranges, but otherwise all the other elements: Attributes, Culture, Class and so on, are factored as normal.

### Dwarf

Dwarves make their homes deep inside mountain strongholds, where extensive tunnels burrow deep into the earth. The average dwarf is strong, tough, and untiring in battle. By nature, they are excellent crafters, often having a propensity for mining and metallurgy, with an accompanying love for treasure and all things material. Their goods are highly sought after by all.

Dwarves are short of stature and somewhat stocky, being between 4' 8" and 4'10" tall on average. Hair color is generally black, gray, or dark brown, but a few are known to exhibit reddish hair. Their skin is ruddy or earth colored. All male dwarves favor long beards, often spiked, braided, or forked. Some dwarven women also grow beards; however, most prefer to keep their faces clean-shaven.

Dwarves are naturally suspicious of anyone espousing a different way of life to their own but are not necessarily antagonistic toward them. They get along best with gnomes, who share a distant kinship, despite their annoying sense of humor and penchant for practical jokes. In addition, dwarves tend to get along well with humans; however, they have a low tolerance of elves due to ancient wars and long memories. Dwarves tend to dislike halflings, whose carefree lifestyle clashes with their gruff, stern nature. Their hatred for orcs, which they view as filthy and bestial, is legendary.

Dwarves are long-lived and can reach ages of around 450 years. They have a distinct aversion to magic and as such find themselves naturally resistant to Arcane spells; Divine spells affect them normally. Because of this, dwarven magic-users are unheard of.

#### Dwarven Culture

Dwarves are social creatures bonded into clans and tribes that share the great underground halls and cities. In this respect, they most closely resemble the Barbarian culture, although there are certain key differences. First, gender does not matter in dwarven society: males and females share duties and responsibilities equally. This includes child-rearing, manual labor, hunting, and war. Second, dwarves tend to downplay the individual in favor of the society.

Dwarves know that strength comes from numbers and that the wants and needs of the individual are always outweighed by the many. They are, however, an acquisitive and materialistic society, jealously guarding their discoveries and achievements. Dwarves like things, and when removed from the clan a lone dwarf can become selfish and individualistic very quickly, because the overall dwarven culture is absent to guide and control the baser instincts.

**Skills**

**Free Skills:** Customs +40, Language (Common) +40, Language (Dwarf) +40

**Standard Skills:** Athletics, Brawn, Endurance, Evade, Locale, Perception, Willpower

**Professional Skills:** Commerce, Craft. (any), Engineering, Language (any\*), Lore (any), Mechanisms, Oratory, Survival.

\* During character creation, additional languages are limited to gnome, goblin, kobold, and orc.

**Alignment and Passions**

**Alignment:** Any, but typically Lawful Good, choose one or two from each, or select a different Alignment.

**Lawful** (Closed-Minded, Hates Chaos, Honest, Honorable, Judgmental, No sense of humor, Obedience to legitimate authority, Organized, Predictable, Reliable, Trustworthy)

**Good** (Admirable, Compunctions against harming innocents, Decent, Ethical, Friendly, Hates Evil, Helpful, Kind, Optimistic, Positive)

**Passion:** Any, but typically one or two from the following:

- Loyalty to Clan
- Love (Something Materialistic)
- Hill Dwarves: Hate (Orcs, half-orcs, goblins, and hobgoblins)
- Mountain Dwarves: Hate (Orcs, goblins, evil giants, and dark elves)

##### Special Rules

**Movement:** 15 feet.

**Darkvision:** Dwarven Darkvision enables them to see up to 60 feet in dim light as if it were bright light (standard Perception rolls to spot something) and in darkness as if it were dim light (Perception rolls to spot something are Hard). Within that darkness, they discern colors only in shades of gray. Darkvision does not allow vision in magical darkness.

**Literate:** Dwarves are typically able to read and write any language they can speak.

**Magic Resistance:** Magic Resistance: Dwarves are highly resistant to Arcane Magic; their Willpower Checks are one grade easier when used to resist. This resistance has no effect on Divine magic.

**Poison Resistance:** Dwarves are also highly resistant to poison, with Endurance rolls that relate to poisoning being one grade easier.

**Tunnel Sense:** Due to their subterranean nature, dwarves can detect certain underground phenomena by succeeding at an Easy Perception skill roll. Tunnel Sense may be used to detect stonework pits, deadfalls, and traps; a slope or grade; approximate depth underground; new tunnel or passage construction; and shifting or sliding walls or rooms. The range of this detection is limited to 10 feet.

### Elf

Elves are around the same height as humans and possess graceful and slender builds. Very few elves leave their woodland realm and take up the adventuring life, instead preferring a peaceful woodland existence. Those that do are a mystery to even their own kind. Though elves get along reasonably well with halflings and gnomes, they do not mesh well with dwarves due to their rather gruff nature. Even humans are viewed with suspicion. Of all the races, orcs and goblins are despised above all due to a long-standing animosity based on endless wars and petty skirmishes. Like dwarves, elves are very long-lived, but even more so, reaching ages of around 1,100 years. However, long before this, elves often feel the need to depart the realms of men. To where they go is a mystery to all but themselves.

Elves are distinctive with their fine bone structure, narrow tapering skulls, and narrow pointed ears. Eye colors vary through the spectrum, from the human tones through to the color of brilliant gems. Elven society is frequently monarchical, usually governed by a king, queen, or both. Elves are otherworldly. They often seem remote from mundane events yet exhibit a comprehension of them that proves baffling for humans to understand. Nature is of great importance to the elves and so they take great care to preserve their environments. As a long-lived species, they do not accept or appreciate time in the same way as humankind and are often unconscious of the passing of short time increments.

#### Elven Culture

Elven culture is akin to Civilized. Great store is placed on learning and understanding. Deeds, conduct, and integrity are important and desired qualities among elves and in others. Dignified manners are expected, and loutish, uncouth behavior viewed with disdain and suspicion. Most elven societies have a king or queen and so loyalty to the monarch is paramount. Elves have trouble understanding societies that lack such structures, wondering how people can be properly ordered without a clear, royal leader to guide and represent them.

**Sharp Vision:** Due to their acute visual acuity, elves find all Perception rolls to spot something one grade easier.

**Stealthy:** Elves wearing nothing more restrictive than light armor find Stealth tests 1 grade easier.

### Gnome

At 3'4" to 3'7" in height, gnomes are even smaller than their dwarven kin. Possessing brown or tan skin, white hair, and considerably larger noses, they are, however, less rotund overall. Possessing an almost uncontrollable tendency for practical jokes and a sense of humor that could get them killed in the shadier parts of world, gnomes balance these problematic traits with a keen love of nature almost equaling that of the elves. Like dwarves, gnomes particularly love gems and jewelry, and many are experts in the gem-cutting craft. They dwell in mines and burrows found in areas of rolling hills and woodlands secluded from humans. Gnomes are suspicious of races much larger than themselves, and apart from dwarves and halflings, that is pretty much everyone. They tend to gauge a person's true intention with a test of his or her sense of humor, not the wisest of methods surely, but it seems to work for them. Gnomes are expert tellers of tall-tales and wild stories. Of all the races, they get along best with dwarves, but in general are more willing to accept others. Typically, gnomes can live to around 700 years.

#### Culture

Gnomish culture is a clannish society that spends much of its time mining and crafting fine jewelry. Their lives are well organized with their leadership culmination with that of a chief, and religious matters being handled by the chief's cleric advisors. In this way their culture is like that of their dwarven kin, however they do tend to love games and practical jokes more so than their squat cousins. Their love of animals and nature means that in addition to dwarves, they relate well to elves and other woodland beings.

**Darkvision:** Gnomish Darkvision enables them to see up to 60 feet in dim light as if it were bright light (standard Perception rolls to spot something) and in darkness as if it were dim light (Perception rolls to spot something are Hard). Within that darkness, they discern colors only in shades of gray. Darkvision does not allow vision in magical darkness.

**Magic Resistance:** Like dwarves, gnomes are highly resistant to Arcane Magic; Willpower Checks are one grade easier when used to resist, two grades easier with regards to illusions. This resistance has no effect on Divine magic. Many gnomes that become magic-users specialize in the School of Illusion.

**Poison Resistance:** Gnomes are also highly resistant to poison, with Endurance rolls that relate to poisoning being 1 grade easier.

**Tunnel Sense:** Due to their subterranean nature, gnomes can detect certain underground phenomena by succeeding at an Easy Perception skill roll. Tunnel Sense may be used to detect stonework pits, deadfalls, and traps; a slope or grade; approximate depth underground; new tunnel or passage construction; and shifting or sliding walls or rooms. The range of this detection is limited to 10 feet.

### Half-Elf

Half-elves are the offspring of an elf and a human, granting them a mixture of traits from both parents. Their appearance is closer to their elven heritage; they tend to possess attractive features. Half-elves lose some of the Abilities of elven heritage and do not have the same lucky or gifted nature as humanity; instead, they fall somewhere in-between. Half-elves possess their human parent's wanderlust and the love of nature of their elven heritage. They are also long-lived, reaching ages of around 300 years. In some parts of world, half-elves are regarded with suspicion due to their mixed heritage, but they are generally accepted everywhere elves and humans are, though they tend to receive the greatest amount of bigotry from the elven people.

#### Culture

Half-elves have no communities of their own but can be found living wherever humans and elves co-mingle, and they will typically share the culture of the race that raised them. For example, if raised among humans they will share the culture of their human parent (one of the four detailed under humans), if raised among elves they will share their elven parent's culture.

### Half-Orc

Originating in the wilder frontiers of world, where orcs and humans come into conflict, half-orcs are the result of the unlikely union between these two races. Genetically, half-orcs exhibit more orcish traits than human ones, standing taller than a human on average, with large prominent teeth, an extended lower jaw, and greenish skin covered with coarse dark hair. They are warlike by nature and have no interest in the more refined of pursuits. Half-orcs are on poor terms with the other races due to their orcish blood, enmity with the elves and dwarves being the greatest; but given time, a trust can develop even with these unlikely races. Of all the races the half-elves tend to be the most sympathetic, understanding the life of the outcast all too well. Strangely enough, gnomes and halflings tend to be generally accepting of half-orcs, the former because half-orcs tend to be able to take a joke, and the latter due to their curious and accepting natures. Half-orcs have natural lifespans of around 80 years.

#### Culture

Like half-elves, half-orcs have no native lands, most often living among orcish tribes. Those not living among other orcs, range toward human lands. Because they are frequently not accepted by society, half-orcs are usually drawn toward violent careers befitting their great strength and temperament, usually finding companionship among adventurers, many of whom are fellow wanderers and outsiders. Half-orcs typically share the culture of the race that raised them. For example, if raised among humans, they will share the culture of their human parent; if raised among orcs, they will share their orcish parent's culture.

\* During character creation, if raised by orcs, additional languages are limited to goblin, hobgoblin, orc, and gnoll. If raised by humans, you are not limited in selection of languages if you can justify the choice.

**Alignment and Passions**

Choose from a human culture or from the following orc Passions if raised in orcish society:

**Orc Alignment:** Any, but typically Lawful Evil if raised by orcs, choose one or two from each or select a different Alignment. Or as per human parent.

**Lawful** (Adherence to tradition, Calculating, Closed-Minded, Lack of adaptability)

**Evil** (Abusive, Cruel, Domineering, Enjoys Harming Innocents, Hates Good, Merciless, Sadistic, Slaver, Spiteful)

**Passion (Raised as Orc):** Any, but typically one or two from the following:

- Loyalty to Clan Chieftain
- Love (friend, sibling, or romantic lover)
- Hate (magic, creature, rival, or clan)

**Passion (Raised as Human):** Choose from an appropriate human list.

**Special Rules**

**Movement:** 20 feet.

**Darkvision:** Half-orc Darkvision enables them to see up to 60 feet in dim light as if it were bright light (standard Perception rolls to spot something) and in darkness as if it were dim light (Perception rolls to spot something are Hard). Within that darkness, they discern colors only in shades of gray. Darkvision does not allow vision in magical darkness.

**Illiterate:** If raised by orcs, half-orcs are typically unable to read or write. They may learn literacy by spending 1 Experience Roll and a month of training under a character literate in the desired language. This gives them basic literacy equal to half skill level in one language the character knows. If desired, another 1 Experience Roll and a month of training will give them full literacy. When learning new languages in play, it can be assumed they are learning them at full literacy level. Half-orcs raised by another culture will be literate if that culture is also literate.

**Survival Bonus (Specific):** If raised by orcs, half-orcs find all Survival rolls pertaining to their area of origin one grade easier.

### Halfling

Peaceful, civilized folk who live a largely agrarian existence, halflings are diminutive humanoids who standing an average of 4'0" to 4'3" tall are shorter than dwarves, but taller than gnomes. Their homes are farms and steads with villages forming close-knit communities. Halflings are the least adventurous of the races and can go largely unnoticed as they pose no kind of threat to anyone.

At first glance halflings might be mistaken for children, but the differences are obvious upon close inspection. Halflings have pointed ears, and skin, hair, and eye colors that run the normal range. They have large, rugged feet that are oversized for the body, and typically quite hairy. Shoes and boots are shunned; the soles of the feet are extremely thick, providing more than adequate protection against rocks and stones.

While they are generally unadventurous, halflings are inquisitive. They like to know, and share, secrets. They adore stories, myths, and fables and have inquiring minds. This means that, when abroad, the world is a fascinating place to be questioned and taken in – and this can lead halflings into trouble. Otherwise, halflings are a rather prosaic, content race that keeps to itself and prefer neither to interfere with the wider world nor have it interfere with them.

To most other races, halflings are short hairy-footed kleptomaniacs, a not entirely unfounded view, as most that take up a life of adventure can easily incorporate a little stealth and subterfuge due to their small size and quick fingers, but other Classes can and do exist. There is an old dwarf saying which goes, "if there is a halfling in your party check your money pouch, if it's missing check his."

Despite being physically smaller and weaker than most other sapient species, halflings compensate with a certain nimbleness that serves them well in sticky situations. Although cautious, they are not cowardly: halflings might say they are, but when it comes to fighting for their homes and way of life, they can summon enormous reserves of courage. In short, halflings make for good player characters, especially for those players who prefer sneaking around to stalking boldly across the moorland. They are long-lived, with lifespans of around 170 years.

#### Culture

Halfling culture is akin to Civilized. They live in small communities called shires, closely-knit villages and small towns with several extended families forming the basis of the community. Their industries are basic: agriculture primarily, but also handicrafts such as pottery, weaving, leatherworking, and textiles. They do work metals but very infrequently for weapons and armor. Like elves, most halflings will never leave their communities. Instead, they prefer staying at home, eating their twelve meals a day, smoking pipe weed, and drinking while socializing with friends and loved ones. But occasionally, a halfling comes along that gets the urge for adventure. The common cultural unit for halflings is the Riding; an area bounded by three shires which makes the size of each riding vary considerably. A Borough is formed of three Ridings.

- Love (Something emotional)
- Hate (Heavy Industry)

**Special Rules**

**Literate:** Halflings are typically able to read and write any language they can speak.

**Poison Resistance:** Halflings are also highly resistant to poison, with Endurance rolls that relate to poisoning being one grade easier.

**Stealthy:** Halflings wearing nothing more restrictive than light armor find Stealth tests 1 grade easier.

**Exposure Tolerance (Feet):** Halflings suffer no adverse effects from exposure when going around barefoot regardless of temperature. They do suffer from exposure normally as far as the rest of their body is concerned.

# Chapter 3: Classes

Every Classic Fantasy Imperative character starts the game having been trained in a Class. This Class is the career the character has embarked on as part of the transition to adulthood, and it further defines the character's skills development.

Players are free to choose a racially and culturally appropriate Class for their character, provided that the Games Master deems it suitable. The write-ups give some guidance as to the races that commonly gravitate toward that Class. These suggestions are not definitive and may be altered by player choice, or to suit more exotic game settings. For example, in a campaign based on a dying desert world, where the halflings are a tribal, cannibalistic people, it would not be out of the question to allow them to become berserkers. The players should not view these race/culture restrictions as hard and fast rules, but rather as standard starting points. Players should feel free to suggest alternatives to their Games Master who, in turn, may allow a normally unusual combination of Race and Class to fit a more out-of-ordinary campaign setting or reward a creative background story.

## Class Rank Structure

Classic Fantasy Imperative's Class and Rank structure is based on various organizations such as Orders or Guilds. For example, the Fighter's Guild, Clerical Order, Magic-User's Guild, and Thieves' Guild.

Rank is used as a tool to guide character development and most Class structures are arranged in a pyramidal hierarchy. Common members (Rank 0) form the base of the pyramid and are the most numerous members of a Class.

Higher ranks (Rank 1–5) represent professional members of the Class, who are working full time under its edicts.

Numbers diminish as one advances up through the ranks until only a handful of individuals, or even only one, occupy the upper echelons. Advancement brings greater privilege, prestige, learning, and sometimes, magic, or other benefits.

### Increasing in Rank

Characters seek to rise in the ranks in the pursuit of greater respect, reputation, or responsibility, or simply out of a thirst for knowledge and power.

Each Class requires several Class skills at a particular level for Advancement. When the character is first created, these skills will determine the character's initial Rank. Having any 5 Class skills at 40% or greater will place the character at Rank 1, since it demonstrates that the person is capable and worthy of the special Abilities of that Rank. Otherwise, the character begins at Rank 0. When the character finally becomes Rank 1, all Abilities that are not specified as Ranked, may be acquired at no cost in Experience Rolls, as the character can be assumed to have been practicing these Abilities in play. Ranked Abilities may be purchased normally with Experience Rolls once Rank 1 is attained.

When a further degree of mastery is reached, based on the character's Skills, the character again increases in Rank. At that point Abilities and spells rated at that Rank may be learned, as the character has demonstrated the necessary level of comprehension and skill.

For the most part, if the character is in good standing with any Oaths required of the Class and possesses the required number of Class skills at the required level, the character will automatically increase to the appropriate Rank. Each Rank above 1 also allows characters to add another Luck Point to their total, giving them a better chance of surviving tougher encounters without needing to artificially increase their Hit Points. Each Class possesses a table detailing the skill requirements per Rank, as well as a summary of any available Ranked Talents and/or Abilities. The following provides a description of each element within these tables:

- Rank: A numerical representation of the character's Rank.
- Title: The title granted a character of the appropriate Rank.
- Advancement: The number of class skills and the required skill level needed to gain the relevant Rank. These may be chosen from any of the listed class skills. There is no need to select them beforehand. Skills that receive a +40 bonus, such as Customs and Native Languages, never count towards advancement.
- Spells in Memory: If applicable, this shows how many spells of each Rank you may have memorized.
- Hit Points: Certain ranks grant an additional Hit Point, which is added to all locations. The noted value includes all previous bonuses.
- Luck Points: Each Rank after the first grants the character 1 additional Luck Point. The noted value includes all previous bonuses.
- Action Points: Certain ranks grant an additional Action Point. The noted value includes all previous bonuses.

### Cleric

Clerics are the militant arm of a religious order and are skilled in protecting their religion and its followers. During times of relative peace, clerics travel the land spreading the word of their pantheon and seeking converts. Clerics are blessed with the ability to cast spells by the deities of their pantheon and are also masters of combat against the undead, possessing the capacity to drive them away with but a spoken prayer.

#### Common Species/Culture

Any.

#### Important Characteristics

STR, INT, POW, and CHA

#### Alignment/Oath Requirements

Alignment: Any, as appropriate to pantheon or deity.

See Chapter 4: Alignment and Passions.

Clerical Oath 30% plus character's INT+POW

In addition to racial/cultural Alignment and Passions, all clerics swear an Oath of Conduct to their clerical order and the deity or pantheon of deities the order venerates. Part of the Oath typically includes tithing 10% of all wealth to the order. Where a pantheon is concerned, the character's Alignment will be used to help determine which deities of the desired pantheon will be worshipped. Typically, an order will devote themselves to all deities of a specific pantheon with like Passions. A cleric typically aligns with all deities of a specific pantheon with an Alignment not contrary to their own. For example, a cleric with a Good Alignment would serve and respect all good and neutral deities of their pantheon. They may work against those deities of an evil disposition, or even acknowledge and respect them, but would offer them no worship. A True Neutral cleric may choose either good or evil deities along with those of neutral disposition if desired but could not choose both.

#### Class Skills

Standard Skills: Combat Skill (Cleric), First Aid, Influence, Insight, Locale, Sing, Willpower

Professional Skills: A cleric automatically receives Channel and Devotion (specific pantheon or deity), plus 3 additional skills from the following: Bureaucracy, Courtesy, Culture (any), Healing, Lore (Alchemy), Lore (Religion), Language (any) or Lore (any), and Oratory.

#### Cleric Armor and Weapon Proficiency

Clerics are proficient with all types of armor (light and heavy), and with all shields (except tower shields). Clerical Divine spell casting is not hindered by the wearing of armor. Their Combat Skill includes the use of all basic weapons. Specialty clerics may have access to different weapons as a part of their Combat Skill. This is beyond the scope of this document however Games Masters may apply this information if they decide to.

#### Rank Structure

All clerics are rated by Rank, which is a rating of power and skill. When a specific degree of mastery is gained in a limited number of Class skills, clerics may increase their Rank as they will have demonstrated the necessary level of aptitude. When this level of aptitude is reached an addition Luck Point is gained and new Abilities may be acquired. This information is found on the following table under Advancement. Assuming you meet the prerequisites, your character begins as a Rank 1 Initiate with the appropriate Abilities noted below; otherwise, you start as a Rank 0 Lay Member with the Ability to cast Rank 0 spells, no other Abilities.

| _ **Rank** _ | **Title** | **Advancement** | **Spells in Memory** | **Hit Points** | **Luck Points** | **Action Points** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _0_ | Lay Member | - | Rank 0: INT/4 | 0 | +0 | +0 |
| _1_ | Initiate | Any 5 Class skills at 40% | Rank 0: INT/4, +1 Rank 1: INT/4 | 0 | +0 | +0 |
| _2_ | Cleric | Any 5 Class skills at 70% | Rank 0: INT/4, +2 Rank 1: INT/4, +2 Rank 2: INT/4 | +1 | +1 | +1 |
| _3_ | Priest or Priestess | Any 4 Class skills at 90% | Rank 0: INT/4, +3 Rank 1: INT/4, +4 Rank 2: INT/4, +2 Rank 3: INT/4 | +1 | +2 | +1 |
| _4_ | High Priest or High Priestess | Any 3 Class skills at 110% | Rank 0: INT/4, +4 Rank 1: INT/4, +6 Rank 2: INT/4, +4 Rank 3: INT/4, +2 Rank 4: INT/4 | +2 | +3 | +2 |
| _5_ | Grand Priest or Grand Priestess | Any 2 Class skills at 130% | Rank 0: INT/4, +5 Rank 1: INT/4, +8 Rank 2: INT/4, +6 Rank 3: INT/4, +4 Rank 4: INT/4, +2 Rank 5: INT/4 | +2 | +4 | +2 |

#### Starting Abilities

The cleric knows all the following Abilities at Rank 1. In addition, during character creation, you may choose one Rank 1 Ability for free assuming you meet its requirements.

- Spellcaster: Clerics are masters of Divine magic, able to cast spells of healing, defense, and protection to aid their allies. However, they are not without powerful offensive spells to smite those that stand against their ideals. Unlike magic-users, clerics require no spell book, having access to all spells of their Rank or below. Casting spells requires 1 or more Cast Magic Actions consisting of a few brief prayers, somatic gestures with their holy symbol, and a successful Channel roll. The number of spells of their current Rank a cleric may have in memory is found on the Rank Structure Table above under Spells in Memory.
- Starting Spells: A cleric begins with access to all cleric spells and Rank 0 spells of their Rank or less. See Cleric Spell Lists on page XX. They do not actually know them, like a magic-user 'knows' spells, but may pray for any of them when choosing which spells to memorize. The number of spells the cleric may memorize at each Rank is found on the cleric's Rank Table above. See Memorizing Spells in Chapter XX
- Turn Undead: Clerics may turn undead, driving them away by means of faith alone. Turning Undead is detailed on page XX.

#### Ranked Abilities

Like the name implies, Ranked Abilities are only selectable by a character of a certain Rank or higher. Most have a Prerequisite Skill that must be at a certain skill level or higher. You are not locked out of earlier Abilities when a new Rank is attained. If you failed to take a Rank 2 Ability for example, you may go back and take it at Rank 3 or even later. No more than a single Ranked Ability may be taken per session.

#### Rank 1:

For each expenditure of 1 Experience Roll you may gain one of the following Abilities (one per session, and each Ability may only be taken once):

- Powerful Concentration: Requires Devotion of 50% or higher. Willpower tests to maintain Concentration regarding spells and spell casting are one grade easier.
- Greater Turning: Requires Willpower of 60% or higher. Turning Power may be re-rolled if desired, however the new roll must be used.
- Holy Smite: Requires Devotion and Willpower of 50% or higher. The cleric may increase their Damage Modifier by one grade against undead, demons, and devils. Usable once per day per Rank attained.
- Mental Strength: Requires Devotion of 60% or higher. Once per day you find it 2 grades easier to perform Willpower checks when resisting any form of magic that targets the mind. This includes such powers as beguiling, charm, domination, hold, hypnosis, Magic Jar, possession, sleep, suggestion, and psionic mind blast. It has no effect on skills such as Influence or Seduction. You also find it 1 grade easier to Disbelieve illusions and phantasms. In the case of elves, this does not stack with their resistance to Sleep and Charm, but it does broaden their ability to resist additional effects.
- Weapon Precision: You are adept at using small, concealable, weapons that do not require a lot of strength, subtly and effectively. This allows you to calculate Damage Modifier with these weapons based on STR+DEX instead of STR+SIZ if it would generate a better result. The Damage Modifier cannot exceed weapons normal damage die. For example, a dagger with a damage of 1d4+1, would be limited to a Damage Modifier of +1d4, making it 1d4+1+1d4. This covers clubs, daggers, garrotes, knives, shortswords, main gauche, and rapiers. as well as unarmed attacks. Darts, slings, short bows, and javelins fall into this category as well.

#### Rank 2:

For each expenditure of 2 Experience Rolls you may gain one of the following Abilities (each may only be taken once):

- Characteristic Increase: You may add +1 to a Characteristic of your choosing. This may not exceed racial maximums.
- Defensive Reflexes I: Defensive Reflexes requires you to be Unburdened (Less 'Things' carried than STR), wearing nothing more restrictive than light armor. Once per combat you may re-roll a Failed Parry or Evade roll without spending a Luck Point.
- Extra Turning: Requires Devotion and Willpower of 80% or higher. The cleric may double the number of times between rests that they may Turn. Twice at Rank 1, four times at Rank 3, and six times at Rank 5.

- Backpack (10 Thing capacity); waterskin, one week's trail rations, bedroll, small empty sack\*, flint and tinder1, 2 six-hour torches (5½ Things contained)
- Belt pouch with 1d4 gold pieces

Total ENC 7½ Things

1 Counts as 1/2 a Thing

\* Contents count toward the backpack's contents as its volume is increased

#### Turning Undead

Clerics of any Alignment may attempt to turn any undead within 30 feet. Evil clerics may choose to control undead instead, if desired. You may attempt to turn undead once at Rank 1, twice at Rank 3, and three times at Rank 5. You regain all uses of turn after a Short Rest of at least 1 hour.

For example, Alexandra is a Rank 4 cleric. She can attempt to turn two times during an encounter, and if she rests at least an hour after, will regain both uses.

**Turning Power** : A cleric's Turning Power modifies the total Intensity of undead who are successfully Turned. This is equal to 1d6+2, +2 per additional Rank beyond 1, and should be noted on the Character Sheet, as the character uses it whenever succeeding at a Turn attempt.

For example, at Rank 2, Alexandra has a Turning Power of 1d6+4

To attempt a Turning requires an Opposed skill test using Channel skill vs. the relevant creature with the highest Willpower within the Area of Effect. The degree of success determines the effects of the attempt.

Evil clerics may command their Turning Power in Intensity undead. This effect allows the cleric to issue commands to the undead but does not make them subservient unless they roll a Critical Success—sapient undead do not needlessly throw away their unlife. Those with the lowest Intensity are always affected first. This has no effect on Intensity 7 or higher undead. An evil cleric may use this to bring previously turned non-sapient undead under their control once again.

- **Critical Success** : Twice your Turning Power in Intensity undead are affected. If your Rank is twice the Intensity (or more) of a non-sapient undead creature, you destroy outright any that you would normally Turn.
  - Evil clerics may instead command twice their Turning Power in Intensity of undead for 12 Rounds (1 minute). As undead are typically of the same mindset as an evil cleric, this effect allows the character to issue commands to the undead. It does not make them subservient, as with Enslave below, and sapient undead will not needlessly throw away their unlife. Those with the lowest Intensity are always affected first. This has no effect on Intensity 7 or higher undead. An evil cleric may use this to bring previously turned non-sapient undead under control once again.
  - Alternately, an evil cleric scoring a Critical Success may enslave their Turning Power in Intensity of undead, enslaving them to their control. Enslaved undead are completely subservient to the cleric until their control is somehow broken. Those with the lowest Intensity are always enslaved first. This has no effect on Intensity 7 or higher undead. An evil cleric may use this to bring previously turned undead under control once again.
- **Success** : Your Turning Power in Intensity of undead are affected, starting with those of the lowest Intensity first. If insufficient Turning Power is rolled to affect anything, then nothing is turned during this attempt. The cleric repulses those affected, which must move and stay at least 20 feet away for 12 Rounds (1 Minute). The affected cannot attack any members of the cleric's party who remain within the Area of Effect unless the affected are forced within 10 feet of the party. Those that cannot move the full distance due to intervening terrain cower (any Attack rolls against them are one Difficulty Grade easier). Approaching within 10 feet of the affected causes the undead to overcome being Turned and act normally. Ranged attacks no closer than 10 feet do not break the Turning effect; however, such attacks on a sapient undead break the effects of the Turn, allowing creature to react normally. Sapient creatures once Turned are allowed a Hard Willpower to roll each Round to try to break the effect; however, sapient creatures likely voluntarily flee the area and return only when they again have the advantage. If the cleric's Rank is twice the Intensity (or more) of a non-sapient undead creature, the cleric destroys outright any that they would normally Turn.
  - An evil cleric may command their Turning Power in Intensity of undead creatures, bringing them under their control. This effect allows the cleric to issue commands to the undead. It does not make them subservient, as with a Critical, and sapient undead will not needlessly throw away their unlife. Those with the lowest Intensity are always affected first. This has no effect on Intensity 7 or higher undead. An evil cleric may use this to bring previously turned non-sapient undead under their control once again.
- **Failure** : No undead Turned.
- **Fumble** : Not only did you fail to Turn anything, but you have drawn the attention of several undead equal to twice your Turning Power in Intensity. These entities target you specifically, with lowest Intensity entities provoked first.

### Magic-User (Mage)

Magic-users study the esoteric, digging through old musty tombs for new and elusive spells to add to their spell books. They spend much of their free time studying these spells and learning to master the powers found within them. While weak starting out, mages have the potential to become the most powerful of the Classes.

#### Common Species/Culture

Any, but typically Civilized and Nomadic humans, as well as gnomes, elves, and half-elves. Gnomes that become mages tend to gravitate toward the School of Illusion.

#### Important Characteristics

DEX, INT, and POW

#### Alignment/Oath Requirements

Alignment: Mages are not restricted by Alignment and require no Oath.

See Chapter 4: Alignment and Passions.

Standard Skills: Evade, First Aid, Influence, Insight, Locale, Perception, Willpower

Professional Skills: A mage automatically receives Arcane Casting and Arcane Knowledge, plus 3 additional skills from the following: Culture (any), Language (any), Lore (Alchemy), Lore (any)

#### Mage Armor and Weapon Proficiency

Mages are not proficient with any type of armor or shields, as Arcane spells require precise gestures and movements during casting, which are hindered by the wearing of armor. They are typically not trained in physical combat; therefore, the mage Combat Skill may only be developed with Bonus Skill Points. It includes the use of daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, and light crossbows, simple weapons commonly found around their master's residence or that are relatively easy to pick up and learn.

#### Rank Structure

All mages are rated by Rank, which is a rating of power and skill.

#### Starting Abilities

The mage knows the following Abilities at Rank 1. In addition, during character creation, you may choose one Rank 1 Ability for free assuming you meet its requirements.

- Spellcaster: While mages are very weak at the beginning of their careers, at the other end of the spectrum, they can cast the most spectacular and powerful of spells, able to burn armies, and collapse castles with impunity. All Arcane spells require precise gestures and movements (the spell's somatic component) during casting, which are hindered by the wearing of armor. See Casting in Armor on page XX for specific information. The number of spells of their current Rank a mage may have in memory is found on the Rank Structure Table above under Spells in Memory.
- Starting Spells: Cantrips are the first magical abilities taught to an apprentice mage and are fully defined in the Spells chapter. A mage begins with knowledge of the Rank 0 cantrip Read Magic, as well as two cantrips (Rank 0) for every 1/10th Arcane Knowledge (skill x 0.1). If the mage qualifies as Rank 1, they also know one Rank 1 spell for every 1/10th Arcane Knowledge. The number of spells the mage may have prepared at each Rank is found on the mage's Rank Table above under Spells in Memory. See the Mage Spell Lists on page XX. See Memorizing Spells on page XX.

#### Ranked Abilities

As the name implies, Ranked Abilities are only selectable by a character of a certain Rank or higher. Most have a Prerequisite Skill that must be at a certain skill level or higher before it may be selected. You are not locked out of earlier Abilities when a new Rank is attained. If you failed to take a Rank 2 Ability for example, you may go back and take it at Rank 3 or even later. No more than a single Ability may be taken per session.

#### Rank 1:

For each expenditure of 1 Experience Roll you may gain one of the following Abilities (one Ability per session, each Ability may only be taken once):

- **Powerful Concentration** : Requires Arcane Casting of 50% or higher. Willpower tests to maintain Concentration regarding spells and spell casting are one Difficulty Grade easier.
- **Mental Strength** : Requires Arcane Casting of 60% or higher. Once per day you find it 2 Difficulty Grades easier to perform Willpower checks when resisting any form of magic that targets the mind. This includes such powers as beguiling, charm, domination, hold, hypnosis, Magic Jar, possession, sleep, suggestion, and psionic mind blast. It has no effect on skills such as Influence or Seduction. You also find it 1 grade easier to Disbelieve illusions and phantasms. In the case of elves, this does not stack with their resistance to Sleep and Charm, but it does broaden their ability to resist additional effects.
- **Weapon Precision** : You are adept at using small, concealable, weapons that do not require a lot of strength, subtly and effectively. This allows you to calculate Damage Modifier with these weapons based on STR+DEX instead of STR+SIZ, whichever generates a better result. The Damage Modifier cannot exceed the weapon's normal damage die. For example, a dagger with a damage of 1d4+1, would be limited to a Damage Modifier of +1d4. This covers clubs, daggers, garrotes, knives, shortswords, main gauche, and rapiers. As well as unarmed attacks. Darts, slings, short bows, and javelins fall into this category as well.

- **Characteristic Increase** : Add +1 to a Characteristic of your choosing. This must not exceed racial maximums.
- **Mental Strength II** : Requires Mental Strength and Arcane Knowledge of 80% or higher. As per Mental Strength, but usable twice per day.
- **Ranged Touch (X)**: Requires Willpower of 80% or higher. This Ability allows the caster to give a spell with a Range of "Touch," a Range of 30 feet instead. The spell is considered one Rank higher with regards to memorization and should be noted as ranged when memorized. For example, Invisibility (Ranged) would count as a Rank 2 spell.

#### Rank 3:

For each expenditure of 3 Experience Rolls you may gain one of the following Abilities (each may only be taken once):

- Characteristic Increase: Add +1 to a Characteristic of your choosing. This may not exceed racial maximums.

- Mental Strength III: Requires Mental Strength II and Arcane Knowledge of 100% or higher. As per Mental Strength, but usable three times per day.

#### Rank 4:

### Rogue

Rogues are the experts in subterfuge, specializing in stealth, traps, lockpicking, and other skills that society often views with suspicion. However, while all thieves are rogues, not all rogues are thieves. Rogues survive by their wits, using their skills of infiltration and stealth for the greater good. However, the greater good often depends on which side of the diamond one is standing.

#### Common Species/Culture

Any

#### Important Characteristics

DEX, INT, and CHA

#### Alignment/Oath Requirements

Alignment: Rogues are not restricted by Alignment and require no Oath unless they are a member of a thieves' guild.

See Chapter 4: Alignment and Passions.

Thieves' Guild Oath 30% plus character's INT+POW

In addition to any racial/cultural Alignment and Passions, rogues who choose to join a thieves' guild must swear an Oath and follow all the normal rules set forth on page XX. In addition, they must abide to the following strictures: display loyalty to other members, abide by all guild rules, act in the guild's best interests (putting the guild before personal interests), keep the guild's secrets safe, pay guild dues, and pay a cut of any job 'sanctioned' by the guild.

Dues vary by location and guild size, but around 100 gold per year is standard. In addition to yearly dues, members are required to pay a cut of any jobs where the guild helped in the form of contacts, tipoffs, maps, general information, and so on. The specific amount of the cut should be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the assistance provided, but an average of 20%, modified up or down is about right. In exchange, the guild provides temporary shelter to the member and their allies, as well as any other services the Games Master deems appropriate. Fences are available to help move stolen merchandise, and through these contacts, a thief can be expected to get about ¼ the item's sale value. Most thieves' guilds have a presence in most major cities and even some large towns.

A rogue may choose to join a thieves' guild after character creation if the Games Master allows. While joining a thieves' guild during character creation costs the character nothing, joining later costs 100 Gold per current Rank, and takes 1 month of training and initiation. After the allotted time, the character takes on the thieves' guild title appropriate to their Rank and adds the Thieves' Guild Oath at 30% plus POW+INT.

#### Skills

Because of their diverse nature, rogues possess more skill choices than the standard allotment. However, they do not receive any extra Skill Points.

Standard Skills: Athletics, Combat Skill (Rogue), Deceit, Evade, Insight, Perception, Stealth

Professional Skills: A rogue automatically receives Lockpicking and Mechanisms, plus two additional skills from the following: Acrobatics, Acting, Commerce, Disguise, Intimidation, Seduction, Slight, or Streetwise. At character creation, members of the Thieves' Guild also receive Language (Thieves' Cant) at +40. If they take it later, they do not receive the +40 bonus.

#### Rogue Armor and Weapon Proficiency

Rogues are proficient with all types of armor (light and heavy), and with all shields (except tower shields). However, they do suffer penalties to many rogue Abilities when wearing heavy armor or when they are encumbered. Their Combat Skill includes the use of all basic weapons, plus hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, and shortswords.

#### Rank Structure

All rogues are rated by Rank, which is a rating of power and skill. You may choose either the rogue or thief titles, depending on whichever is more relevant to your relationship with the thieves' guild. When a specific degree of mastery is gained in a limited number of Class skills, rogues may increase their Rank, as they will have demonstrated the necessary level of aptitude. When this level of aptitude is reached an addition Luck Point is gained and new Abilities may be acquired. This information is found on the following table under Advancement. Assuming you meet the prerequisites, your character begins as a Rank 1 Scoundrel or Burglar with the appropriate Abilities noted below; otherwise, you start as a Rank 0 Scamp or Cutpurse but no other Abilities.

| _ **Rank** _ | **Title (Rogue)** | **Title (Thief)** | **Advancement** | **Hit Points** | **Luck Points** | **Action Points** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _0_ | Scamp | Cutpurse | - | 0 | +0 | +0 |
| _1_ | Scoundrel | Burglar | Any 5 Class skills at 40% | 0 | +0 | +0 |
| _2_ | Rogue | Thief | Any 5 Class skills at 70% | +1 | +1 | +1 |
| _3_ | Master Rogue | Master Thief | Any 4 Class skills at 90% | +1 | +2 | +1 |
| _4_ | Grand Master Rogue | Grand Master Thief | Any 3 Class skills at 110% | +2 | +3 | +2 |
| _5_ | Legendary Rogue | Legendary Thief | Any 2 Class skills at 130% | +2 | +4 | +2 |

#### Starting Abilities

The rogue knows all the following Abilities at Rank 1. In addition, during character creation, you may choose one Rank 1 Ability for free assuming you meet its requirements.

- **Climb Walls** : You are particularly good at climbing anything up to a sheer surface. If you are Unburdened (Less 'Things' carried than STR), and wearing nothing more restrictive than light armor, you may ignore 1 Difficulty Grade to your Athletics roll when performing any attempt at climbing. In addition, the Armor Penalty to Base Movement when climbing may be ignored.
- **Hide in Shadows** : You are an expert in stealth and have perfected the art of hiding in shadows. If you can position yourself in an area enshrouded in shadow, all Perception rolls to spot you are 1 Difficulty Grade harder.
- **Sneak Attack** : The rogue may attempt to neutralize a victim from an advantageous position if armed with a small or medium melee weapon or using a Ranged Weapon within 30 feet of the victim. The target must be generally humanoid in form and possess vital organs. It has no effect on a dragon or gelatinous mass, for example. Because the attacker is typically able to strike without hindrance, they gain Choose Location as a bonus Special Effect if successful. However, the location selected must be the target's head, chest, or abdomen to gain any of the following additional benefits.
  - The attacker may ignore any negative Damage Modifier that normally applies, the Special Effects Bypass Armor and Maximize Damage do not require a Critical Success.
  - It is not necessary for the rogue to gain surprise on the victim; however, the attack must be made from outside the victim's field of vision. Therefore, many rogues wait for an opponent to become engaged with an ally and then take advantage of the distraction to strike from behind. Parrying or Evading a Sneak Attack first requires a Perception roll, a Hard Perception roll if the victim is already distracted. If successful, defending against the attack coming from the side is Formidable, while defending against the attack from behind is a Herculean task! Sneak Attack may only be used on the same target more than once if they remain distracted or otherwise unaware of their attacker.
- **Subterfuge** : Because rogues are masters of infiltration, the skills Lockpicking, Mechanisms, and Sleight are one Difficulty Grade easier.

#### Ranked Abilities

As the name implies, Ranked Abilities are only selectable by a character of a certain Rank or higher. Most have a Prerequisite Skill that must be at a certain skill level or higher. You are not locked out of earlier Ranked Abilities when a new Rank is attained. If you failed to take a Rank 2 Ability for example, you may go back and take it at Rank 3 or even later. No more than a single Ranked Ability may be taken per session.

#### Rank 1:

For each expenditure of 1 Experience Roll the Rogue may gain one of the following Abilities (each may only be taken once):

- **Agile** : Requires Evade or Acrobatics at 60% or higher. Assuming you are Unburdened (Less 'Things' carried than STR) and wearing nothing more restrictive than light armor, you may utilize your superb reflexes in combat. When calculating Initiative, you may add +4 to the total.
- **Artful Dodger** : Requires Evade of 50% or higher. This talent requires you to be Unburdened (Less 'Things' carried than STR) and wearing nothing more restrictive than light armor. You possess fast reflexes and may use the Evade skill to dodge a melee attack without falling prone. Against a ranged attack, you only end up prone if you Fail the roll.
- **Great Hearing** : Requires Perception of 50% or higher. Your acute hearing makes all Perception rolls that pertain to hearing one Difficulty Grade easier.
- **Sharp Eyed** : Requires Perception of 50% or higher. Your acute eyesight makes all Perception rolls that pertain to vision one Difficulty Grade easier.
- **Skirmishing** : Requires Athletics and Combat Skill of 50% or higher. This Ability permits launching ranged attacks in the same Round in which you run (but not while sprinting). However, the attacker's attack percentage cannot exceed his Athletics skill.
- **Swashbuckling** : Requires Combat Skill of 50% or higher. Assuming the character is Unburdened (Less 'Things' carried than STR) and wearing nothing more restrictive than light armor, they may engage in attacks and evades made while jumping or swinging into (or disengaging from) combat, ignoring any skill cap placed on it by the Athletics skill.
- **Unarmored Defense** : Requires the Artful Dodger Ability and either Evade or Acrobatics at 50% or higher. Your character is extremely hard to hit when unhindered by armor. When Unburdened (Less 'Things' carried than STR) and wearing NO armor, your Evade rolls are one Difficulty Grade easier.
- **Vaulting** (requires Acrobatics): Requires Acrobatics at 50% or higher. When Unburdened (Less 'Things' carried than STR), you may use your Acrobatics skill to pole vault according to the following rules. Using a pole of at least quarterstaff length and moving at least at running or sprinting speed, you may vault over obstacles or up onto out-of-the-reach locations. This requires a successful Easy Acrobatics roll, and if successful, will allow you to vault horizontally up to twice your own height +1d4+6 feet. A successful vertical vault will allow you to reach heights equal to the length of the quarterstaff (6 to 9 feet); however, vaulting vertically causes you to end up prone. A character without this Ability that possesses the Acrobatics skill may attempt this feat at normal difficulty. On a Critical Success with a horizontal vault, the distance vaulted may be increased by half again. A Critical Success while vaulting vertically allows you to land upon your feet.
- **Weapon Precision** : You are adept at using small, concealable, weapons that do not require a lot of strength, subtly and effectively. This allows you to calculate Damage Modifier with these weapons based on STR+DEX instead of STR+SIZ, whichever generates a better result. The Damage Modifier cannot exceed double the weapon's normal damage die. For example, a dagger with a damage of 1d4+1, would be limited to a Damage Modifier of +1d4, making it 1d4+1+1d4. This Ability covers clubs, daggers, garrotes, knives, shortswords, main gauche, and rapiers. As well as unarmed attacks. Darts, slings, short bows, and javelins fall into this category as well.

#### Rank 2:

The rogue's Sneak Attack Ability now does +1d2 damage with melee weapons, no additional damage with ranged weapons. In addition, they may take the following Abilities at a cost of 2 EXP rolls each (each may only be taken only once):

- **Characteristic Increase** : You may add +1 to a Characteristic of your choosing. This may not exceed racial maximums.
- **Defensive Reflexes** : Defensive Reflexes requires you to be Unburdened (Less 'Things' carried than STR), wearing nothing more restrictive than light armor. Once per combat You may re-roll a Failed Parry or Evade roll without spending a Luck Point. You may not re-roll against the same attack more than once however, nor combine with a Luck Point.
- **Read Languages** : Requires Oath at 70% or higher and one month of training with the thieves' guild. Only Members of a thieves' guild may take this Ability. You have learned to read any language, even those you do not normally know. This is not a complete understanding of all languages, but the chance to pick up a word here or a phrase there and piece it together. The main use of this skill is the understanding of notes, instructions, and treasure maps, but can be used to attempt to decipher any otherwise unknown language. Read Languages is a Professional Skill and starts at Base Level of INTx2. The Games Master should roll this skill check, keeping the results secret, as you would not know whether you have successfully translated the text, or just think you did. A Success will reveal a few useful pieces of information equal to your INT/4, while a Critical Success will reveal several pieces of information equal to your INT/2. On a Failed roll, you learn no information whatsoever. Finally, on a Fumble, you only believe that you know the correct subject matter and the Games Master can feed you false information.

#### Rank 3:

The rogue's Sneak Attack Ability now does +1d4 damage with melee weapons, +1d2 additional damage with ranged. In addition, they may take the following Abilities at a cost of 3 EXP rolls each (each may only be taken only once):

- **Characteristic Increase II** : You may add +1 to a Characteristic of your choosing. This may not exceed racial maximums.
- **Defensive Reflexes II** : Requires Defensive Reflexes. As per Defensive Reflexes, however you may now use this Ability twice in the same combat. You may not re-roll against the same attack more than once however, nor combine with a Luck Point.
- **Use Arcane Scrolls** : Requires Oath at 90% or higher and one month of training at the thieves' guild. Only Members of a thieves' guild may take this Ability. This Ability allows the rogue to cast spells from any magic-user scroll without the need to have previously cast Read Magic on it. This chance is equal to your INT x5%. Failing this roll automatically results in a Fumble because of your lack of training and understanding of the magical arts. A Fumble reverses the effects of the spell or sets them off on the reader, whichever is most detrimental as determined by the whim of the Games Master.

#### Rank 4:

The rogue's Sneak Attack Ability now does +1d6 damage with melee weapons, +1d4 damage with ranged. In addition, they may take the following Abilities at a cost of 4 EXP rolls each (each may only be taken only once):

- **Characteristic Increase III** : You may add +1 to a Characteristic of your choosing. This may not exceed racial maximums.
- **Defensive Reflexes III** : Requires Defensive Reflexes II. As per Defensive Reflexes, however you may now use this Ability three times in the same combat. You may not re-roll against the same attack more than once however, nor combine with a Luck Point.

#### Rank 5:

The rogue's Sneak Attack Ability now does +1d8 damage with melee weapons, +1d6 damage with ranged. In addition, they may take the following Abilities at a cost of 5 EXP rolls each (each may only be taken only once):

- **Characteristic Increase IV** : You may add +1 to a Characteristic of your choosing. This may not exceed racial maximums.
- **Defensive Reflexes IV** : Requires Defensive Reflexes III. As per Defensive Reflexes, however you may now use this Ability four times in the same combat. You may not re-roll against the same attack more than once however, nor combine with a Luck Point.

# Chapter 4: Alignment & Passions

Using Alignment and Passions in Classic Fantasy Imperative can greatly assist players and Games Masters in deepening the nature of the character, introducing plot hooks based on a character's desire or prejudices, and helping the player to understand who his character is, what drives him, and so on. While the player's specific choice of Alignment and Passions found in this chapter are up to them, some found in the previous chapter pertaining to character Class are required to play that character. None of the Classes in this document require a specific Alignment or Passions, but some like the cleric and rogue (that joins a thieves' guild), require an Oath to their order or guild. An Oath can be treated like a Passion with regards to its game mechanics.

## Alignment

All characters must have an Alignment which consists of two parts: an Ethical Code and a Moral Code. The Ethical Code defines the stance toward law and chaos, while the Morale Code determines feeling toward good and evil. Characters then choose one or two defining elements for each and determine Starting Percentages. For example, Chaotic (Disorganized and Greedy) 55%, and Good (Helpful and Charitable) 55%. You may not choose Neutral twice; instead, you disregard both a Moral and Ethical Code and choose True Neutral as your single Alignment. The Ethical and Moral Codes, along with their defining elements, are detailed below.

### Ethical Code

Choose one of Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic at a Base Level of INT+POW+30.

- **Lawful** : Choose one or two defining elements that best describes your Ethical Code: Adherence to tradition; Calculating; Closed-Minded; Hates Chaos; Ethical; Honest; Honorable; Judgmental; Lack of adaptability; No sense of humor; Obedience to legitimate authority; Organized; Predictable; Reliable; Trusting; Trustworthy; Well-mannered.
- **Neutral** : Choose one defining element that best describes your Ethical Code: Believes Law and Chaos are prejudices and dangerous extremes; Cautious; Conceited; Does not strongly feel one way or the other when it comes to Law and Chaos; Flexible; Freedom of action; Has no established Ethical Code; Pragmatic; Respectful of nature.
- **Chaotic** : Choose one or two defining elements that best describes your Ethical Code: Bad mannered; Bloodthirsty; Curious; Cynicism; Dishonest; Dishonorable; Disorganized; Disregard for legitimate authority; Egoism; Freedom; Hates Law; Irresponsible; Lawless; Megalomaniac; Prankster; Quick to anger; Rampageous; Reckless; Suspicious; Uncontrolled; Untrustworthy; Unpredictable; Unreliable.

### Moral Code

Choose one of Good, Neutral, or Evil at a Base Level of INT+POW+30.

- **Good** : Choose one or two defining elements that best describes your Moral Code: Admirable; Altruistic; Angelic; Authoritative; Charitable; Compunctions against harming innocents; Decent; Forgiving; Friendly; Hates Evil; Helpful; Kind; Loves nature; Merciful; Optimistic; Positive; Vegetarian.
- **Neutral** : Choose one defining element that best describes your Moral Code: Believes Good and Evil are prejudices and dangerous extremes; Cautious; Does not strongly feel one way or the other when it comes to Good and Evil; Flexible; Freedom of Action; Lacks the commitment to make sacrifices to protect or help others; Committed to others by personal relationships, not a Moral Code; Has no established Moral Code; Pragmatic; Seldom seek out company.
- **Evil** : Choose one or two defining elements that best describes your Moral Code: Abusive; Cannibalistic; Covetous; Cruel; Domineering; Enjoys Harming Innocents; Greedy; Hates Good; Lustful; Manipulative; Merciless; Prideful; Sadistic; Self-centered; Selfish; Slaver; Spiteful; Vain; Violent.

### True Neutral

True Neutral starts at a Base Level of INT+POW+30.

- **True Neutral** : Alternately, choose one or two defining elements that best describes your lack of both a Moral and Ethical Code: Ambivalent; Cautious; Committed to others by personal relationships; Flexible; Freedom of action; Open-minded; Pragmatic; Respectful of Nature; Strives for balance.

## Passions

Passions are used to assist players and Games Masters in deepening the nature of the character, introducing plot hooks based on a character's desire or prejudices, and helping the player to understand who his character is, what drives him, and so on.

A Passion can be for anything – a person, an organization, an ideal, even an object. Passions are typically described by a verb such as: Desire, Despise, Destroy, Espouse, Fear, Flee, Forswear, Hate, Love, Loyalty to, Protect, Repudiate, Respect, Seek, Subvert, Torment, or Uphold.

Passions are measured in the same way as skills; they are rated between 1 and 100 (or higher). A Passion can be improved in the same way as a skill, or it can be increased or decreased by the Games Master depending on circumstances.

Beginning characters may start with up to three Passions, each based on two Characteristics, with a bonus of +40 to the first, +30 to the second and +20 to the third, the player deciding the order of importance. These can be tied to the culture, Class, or personal foibles. For example, Distrust (Rogues); Loyal to Queen; Love Family; Defeat Chaos. Passions play a particularly important role in many character Classes as detailed in the next chapter. For some of these Classes, maintaining a Passion at a minimum level is required for the retention of Class-specific special Abilities, and in extreme situations, losing a Passion can result in loss of the Class.

The starting value of the Passion varies according to its type; see the Passions Table, below.

This section only details what Passions represent and their default values. How Passions are used in the game is discussed below.

### Passion Table

| _ **Object of Passion** _ | **Starting Percentage** |
| --- | --- |
| _A person, in a romantic or familial context_ | POW+CHA |
| _An organization or group of people_ | POW+INT |
| _A race or species_ | Character's POW x2 |
| _A place_ | Character's POW+INT |
| _An object or substance_ | Character's POW x2 |
| _A personality trait_ | Character's POW+CHA |

### Using Alignment and Passions

An Alignment or Passion is any deeply held commitment that has the capacity to influence events during play. Although they can be used as stand-alone Abilities (to call them skills is to do them a disservice), Passions are further expanded below to explain in more detail how they work and how they can influence Classic Fantasy Imperative characters and campaigns.

In summary, Alignment and Passions can be used thus:

- To augment another skill, reflecting the depth of one's feelings and how it drives action. When used in this regard, the Alignment or Passion adds 20% of its value to a skill being used, if the augmentation is thematically and dramatically important.
- As an Ability to drive choices, desires and emotional actions and responses. When used in this way a Standard roll is made against an Alignment or Passion to determine how strongly the character thinks and feels about something. If a roll is a Success, then the character acts in line with what the Alignment or Passion would dictate. If the roll Fails, then the character can act freely without feeling constrained by the Passion's drives.
- To oppose other Alignments or Passions – even those held by the same character. This is typically used where an Alignment would conflict with a Passion, or even when two Passions would conflict. For instance, a personal love might dictate a course of action that would be contrary to an Oath or loyalty. Here use an Opposed Roll between the Alignment and Passion, or the two Passions, with the more successful determining how the character acts.
- As a general measure of depth of commitment, belief, and loyalty to a cause. The higher the Alignment or Passion's value, the more committed the character is. Characters with similar Alignments or Passions can compare their ratings to determine who exhibits the deeper commitment.
- To resist some form of psychological manipulation or magical domination. In certain cases where a character is being forced into performing an act contrary to their Alignment or Passions, they may substitute either for Willpower in the Opposed Roll.

A character's Alignment score may drop during play if the character continually disregards their chosen morality and/or ethics. If it drops lower than the character's Base Level, it will change to an opposing Alignment, Good to Neutral or Evil for example. The Games Master should determine the new Alignment and Level, depending on the circumstances. A change of Alignment may result in losing access to Class Abilities. See the relevant Class write-up for details.

New Passions can be developed at any point during a Classic Fantasy Imperative game session if the circumstances warrant it. One might instantly develop 'Hate X' where someone else does something that would strongly invoke hatred to arise. A lord or chief calling for an Oath would immediately establish a Passion of 'Loyalty to X' as soon as that Oath is taken or sworn – something explored further under Oaths on page XX.

New Passions developed during play in this way cost no Experience Rolls and are established there and then. Of course, characters can also choose to establish a Passion during improvement, at the cost of an Experience Roll to gain a Passion at its Base Value: see the charts in the Culture and Race chapter.

### Deepening and Waning

Alignment, Passions, and Oaths can increase during a game independently of Experience Rolls, based on the strength of whatever occurred to trigger the increase. Also, they can, and do, wane. A strongly held belief can be shaken by many things, leading to that Passion being either reduced or, in more extreme circumstances, reversed completely.

For instance, a character with 'Trust Chieftain' might, if his chieftain acts treacherously, either reduce his Passion or turn into 'Distrust Chieftain' at the same percentage. The Games Master needs to determine whether a Passion reduces or reverses. If it reduces, then it does so according to the strength of the source of the change.

The Deepening and Waning table shows how much the Passion changes.

##### Deepening and Waning Table

| _ **Depth of Passion** _ | **Passion Modified by** |
| --- | --- |
| _Weak_ | 1d10 |
| _Moderate_ | 1d10+5 |
| _Strong_ | 1d10+10 |

# Chapter 5: Skills

Skills are divided into two categories: Standard and Professional. All characters have the same set of Standard Skills. Professional Skills differ between individual characters and reflect expertise developed within a career and, to a certain extent, their culture. Despite these distinctions, Standard and Professional Skills work in the same way.

## How Skills Work

A skill has a Base Value built on two Characteristics; or one Characteristic multiplied by two. There is no upper limit to a skill's value; it can exceed 100 and, in play, characters can expect to see their skills reach such heights.

Whenever a character is called upon to resolve some form of test, challenge, or professional ability, 1d100 is rolled and compared with the skill's value:

- Equal to, or less than, the skill indicates a Success.
- Greater than the skill's value indicates a Failure.

There are certain special cases concerning Success and Failure that should be noted.

- Any roll of 01-05 is always a Success.
- Any roll of 96-00 is always a Failure, irrespective of how high the skill's value.

### Criticals and Fumbles

Criticals and Fumbles represent spectacular successes and failures; those cases where a character has either excelled in his attempt or failed miserably and utterly.

- A **Critical Success** is equal to one-tenth of the skill's value (and this includes skills that receive a modifier – so modified skills may have a greater or lesser chance of a Critical outcome). Round fractions up when calculating a Critical Success's range. For example, if a skill is modified to twice its normal value – from 40% to 80% say, then its Critical range would be a roll of 08 or less.
- A **Fumble** is roll of 99 or 00. Skills with a value of more than 100% Fumble only on a roll of 00.

The precise nature of a Critical or Fumble result is left to the Games Master to determine. The consequences could be wondrous or dire, depending on the circumstances.

### Automatic Successes

There will be some occasions where a roll against a particular skill is just not necessary – either because the task at hand is easily accomplished, or because, with enough time and focus, success is guaranteed. Riding a horse at a gentle canter across an open meadow is an example of an Automatic Success where simply being skilled in the activity means that straightforward actions do not require any skill rolls to resolve them. A crafter carving a piece of wood into a chair leg is another example where a skill roll is not necessary; it takes time to accomplish, but the craftsman knows how to do the work and, if not rushing, success is assured. A rogue, undisturbed, with a set of lockpicks, can successfully pick the simple lock of a treasure chest given enough time to do so.

### Modifying Skills

There are some occasions where a skill roll is required, but the chances of success need to be adjusted to reflect existing conditions. Fleeing bandits, for instance, might require an Athletics roll. But what if the character is fleeing through darkness or through treacherous undergrowth? In such a case the Games Master can insist on modifying the skill of the character to reflect the circumstances.

Classic Fantasy Imperative uses a series of grades to determine how a skill is modified. These are as follows. Note that two types of modifiers are provided: the first is the default method, and involves a little math, but offers better simulation for scaling, especially where higher skill percentages are concerned. The Simplified Skill Modifier is a simple addition or subtraction, and easier to implement. Choose which method best fits the game but ensure that the same modification system is applied consistently.

##### Difficulty Grade Table

| _ **Difficulty Grade** _ | **Skill Modifier** | **Simplified Skill Modifier** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _Automatic_ | No need to roll | No need to roll |
| _Very Easy_ | Double the skill value | +40% |
| _Easy_ | Add half again to the skill value | +20% |
| _Standard_ | No adjustment | None |
| _Hard_ | Reduce skill value by one-third | -20% |
| _Formidable_ | Reduce the skill value by half | -40% |
| _Herculean_ | Reduce the skill value to one-fifth | -80% |
| _Hopeless_ | No attempt can be made | No attempt can be made |

Where a character is already suffering a penalty from other circumstances, the hardest Difficulty Grade takes precedence.

Outside of combat, Classic Fantasy Imperative does not provide a definitive list of situations and challenges which can incur skill modifications. What sort of modification is required for any particular skill or context is ultimately up to the Games Master to decide, according to the capabilities of the characters, his perception of the difficulty of the situation and the dramatic tension at that particular moment.

## Standard Skills

### Athletics (STR+DEX)

Athletics covers a range of physical activities, including climbing, jumping, throwing, and running. Skills rolls for any of these activities are handled by a single roll against the Athletics skill. See Movement on page XX for more information on climbing, jumping, and running.

### Boating (STR+CON)

The Boating skill covers the operation of small floating craft. on rivers, lakes, and close inshore. Appropriate vessels are generally boats, canoes, or rafts which travel short distances and are unsuited to the rigors of the open sea. Most are propelled using oars, paddles, punts or simple sails; or can even be towed by animals. Ships with large crews or designed for long, overseas journeys are covered under the Seamanship Professional Skill.

### Brawn (STR+SIZ)

Brawn is the efficient application of technique when applying raw physical force. The skill covers acts of applied might, including lifting, breaking down doors and contests of strength.

### Conceal (DEX+POW)

Conceal is the counterpoint to Stealth, being the concealment of large objects rather than the character themselves. For instance, conceal could be used to hide a chariot behind some rocks, or sweep away the wheel ruts of the chariot so its path cannot be tracked. The skill is versatile in application, anything from hiding a scroll in a library to disguising the presence of a trap or secret passage.

### Customs (INT x2+40)

Customs represents the character's knowledge of his own community, its social codes, rites, rituals, taboos, and so on. The skill is used when it is essential to accurately interpret or perform any socially important custom or to behave in a particular way.

### Dance (DEX+CHA)

Just about every culture uses dance in some way – either as recreation or as part of important rituals. It might be a court dance, a war dance, or a simple set of movements accompanying a prayer or ceremonial chant. The Dance skill measures a character's ability to move rhythmically and accurately (to a reasonable degree) when called upon to do so.

### Deceit (INT+CHA)

Deceit covers all instances where a character attempts to mask the truth and offer a deception of some kind; barefaced lying, misleading a guard, or even bluffing (or cheating) during a card game. The skill also covers instances where hiding true emotions or motives is necessary (feigning pleasure when one is bitterly disappointed perhaps, or attempting to seem welcoming and open when the opposite is true). Deceit forms a counterpart to the Insight skill and can be used to oppose Insight rolls when others are attempting to discern either truth or motive.

### Drive (DEX+POW)

Drive covers the control of wheeled or drawn vehicles, whether by one or more beasts of burden or more esoteric means: such as carts, carriages, chariots, or sleds. Drive rolls are needed when a character wants to do something out of the ordinary with a vehicle – traverse treacherous terrain, jump obstacles, and so on. A roll is also necessary if the vehicle being driven is drawn by different beasts than the driver is used to (horses instead of oxen, for example) or there are more, or fewer beasts teamed together to pull the vehicle.

### Endurance (CON x2)

Endurance is a character's capacity to endure physical stress, pain, and fatigue. It measures the body's ability to deal with potentially damaging or debilitating conditions and is a general gauge of resilience, stamina, and metabolism. Endurance, like its counterpart Willpower, is used in any number of ways, but most specifically to resist the possible effects of injuries, including harmful poisons and disease.

### Evade (DEX x2)

Evade is used to escape from observed, impending danger and can be used against Ranged Weapons (by diving for cover, for example), avoiding traps, changing the engagement distance in combat, and generally getting out of the way of a potential physical hazard. It can also be used as a resistance roll for certain types of magic. Those with the Artful Dodger Ability may use Evade to dodge a melee attack without falling prone. Against a ranged attack, they only end up prone if they Fail the roll.

### First Aid (DEX+INT)

The skill of First Aid measures a character's ability to treat minor injuries and stabilize more severe ones. First Aid may be applied only once per specific injury and heals 1d3 points of damage.

### Influence (CHA x2)

This is a measurement of a character's ability to persuade others, through personal charisma, into a desired way of behaving. It is used in a wide variety of situations; from changing someone's mind, to bribing an official or guard. Influence rolls are typically Opposed by the Perception, Willpower, or another Influence skill, depending on the circumstances, and are modified by how much a character is trying to influence behavior. Attempting to persuade a close friend to loan you their horse may be relatively easy. Getting a usually incorruptible bureaucrat to accept a bribe is more difficult.

### Insight (INT+POW)

Insight is the ability to read or intuitively define another's verbal and non-verbal behavior (such as body language or the manner of speech) to establish their motives and state of mind. Insight is used to determine whether someone is telling a lie (and it can be Opposed by the other person's Deceit skill), or to predict how someone feels about a particular situation. Insight can equally be applied to situations as well as other people: is that tavern a haven for trouble? Could the bandits be planning an ambush in the nearby hills?

### Locale (INT x2)

Locale measures a character's understanding of local flora, fauna, terrain, and weather in the area where he or she has spent much of their life, usually within their community. The character knows the common plants, trees, and animals, their properties and behavior: where the best fish can be found; the movements of game creatures; where to find shelter; the likely weather for the season, and the most common regional dangers. In neighboring, yet unfamiliar locations Locale should be made one or more grades harder.

### Native Tongue (INT+CHA+40)

Native Tongue is the ability to speak and read one's own language, the one learned while growing up in one's home culture. For humans, this is the Common Tongue, while demi-human and other races each have their own native languages. Native Tongue measures articulation, eloquence, and the depth of the speaker's vocabulary.

Unlike other skills, Native Tongue is not rolled against directly. Instead, it is treated as a static representation of overall fluency, limiting the level of conversational interaction. This is described in more detail under the Language skill on page XX, but starting characters usually begin play fully fluent in their native language.

The skill can be used in two ways. First, it can help to understand the dialects of neighboring peoples who share a common linguistic basis or origin. In such cases the skill is treated at least one grade harder, potentially affecting the character's fluency. Second, it can be used as a cap on verbal skills which require a good grasp of language.

### Perception (INT+POW)

Perception is used for both passive observation and focused detection; whether hunting for something specific, a general scan of an area, or simple awareness of their surroundings. Specific conditions – darkness, for example – may affect the Difficulty Grade of the skill roll depending on the primary senses being utilized. Strong scents might make an olfactory Perception roll Easy rather than Standard, whereas trying to eavesdrop on a conversation in a crowded and noisy tavern would make the roll Hard.

### Ride (DEX+POW)

Ride covers the ability to control and remain mounted on those creatures that are trained to be ridden. The skill can be applied to a diverse range of beasts, everything from mules to elephants; even flying or swimming creatures such as giant eagles or dolphins. Riding an unfamiliar species is always one Difficulty Grade harder; while riding a species of a different medium (an equestrian riding a dragon, for example) is two grades harder. Wild, untamed creatures cannot be ridden in a constructive manner until they have been broken and trained to be riding beasts.

### Sing (POW+CHA)

Carrying a tune is covered by Sing, anything from monotonous chants through to complex arias. Singing is an inherent part of most cultures, a prime source of entertainment and perhaps used in its rituals. Important songs might be used for courting, inspiring soldiers before battle, or simply recounting a historical deed. The skill reflects the user's ability to maintain rhythm, keep in key and remember the correct words.

### Stealth (DEX+INT)

Hiding out of plain sight or moving with minimal sound are covered by the Stealth skill. Cover and conditions, such as darkness or loud background noise, improve the grade of the skill according to the specifics of the environment. Similarly, adverse conditions, such as a lack of cover or a quiet night will decrease the skill's grade. Circumstances also affect the difficulty of the attempt. For instance, a warrior wearing heavy armor can easily conceal themselves behind a wall, provided they stand still or move very slowly, whereas moving quickly might cause their armor to jingle.

### Swim (STR+CON)

Without development, the ability to swim is limited to being able to thrash around and keep one's head above the water for a short time. Higher Swim percentages indicate being able to negotiate deeper and stronger waters, with less risk of drowning. Making a Swim roll thus depends entirely on the conditions. Rough seas, strong currents, white water, and rip tides all reduce the grade of the skill no matter what the character's affinity for water might be. See Movement on page XX for more information on swimming, including calculating swim speeds.

### Unarmed (STR+DEX)

Unarmed is a universal Combat Skill common to all characters, measuring the ability to defend oneself without the aid of weapons. The Unarmed skill covers the brawling and wrestling techniques known by that culture.

As Unarmed is a Combat Skill its Critical and Fumble effects are covered by the rules for combat, as detailed in the Combat chapter.

### Willpower (POW x2)

Willpower is a measure of a character's ability to concentrate, channel his force of will in a particular direction, or harden his psyche to possible mental shock. It is also a measure of personal resolve. The skill is used in all manner of situations where mental resilience is required, and this includes resisting magic. Although not a measure of sanity it can be used to endure traumatic events that would shake even the sanest, stable mind. Willpower is the mental counterpart to Endurance.

Again, like Endurance and Evade, Willpower is most often used in Opposed Tests. When used as a Standard test, a Critical Willpower roll indicates that the character has hardened his mind and spirit to the extent that no further attempts to influence him, or shake his resolve, will work. In the case of resisting magic, a Critical Success means that no further mentally afflicting spells cast by the opponent have any effect on the character for the remainder of that encounter.

## Professional Skills

Professional Skills differ between characters and represent more specialized forms of training and experience. Some Professional Skills are gathered through cultural background and a character's Class, as the name suggests. Although they differ between characters they work in the same way as Standard Skills.

Certain magical skills are also classed as Professional Skills: Channeling and Devotion are the two skills associated with Divine magic for example. These are only briefly described here. For more details refer to the relevant magical chapter.

### Acting (CHA x2)

Acting governs the art of being able to impersonate and convey a completely different character, whether in a staged performance or in a social situation. The actor portrays a personality and mannerisms different to his own in a convincing manner. Coupled with the Disguise and Deceit skills, this is a powerful way of becoming someone else entirely.

### Acrobatics (STR+DEX)

Acrobatics covers acts of balance, gymnastics, juggling, and tumbling. The skill can be used to impress an audience, but also to help mitigate damage from falls. With a successful roll, a character can move at full speed and sure-footedly across an unstable or narrow surface. If trying to mitigate damage from an unexpected fall, a successful Acrobatics roll halves any damage sustained. In addition, if the roll is successful and the character does not suffer a Serious or Major Wound due to the fall, the character lands relatively safely and is not prone.

Acrobatics can be substituted for Evade if the situation warrants it. The benefit of this is that the character automatically regains their footing rather than being rendered prone.

Acrobatics also serves as the basis for the Rogue's Vaulting Ability (see page XX).

### Animal Handling (POW+CHA)

This skill serves several functions, including attempting to calm a hostile animal or training a domestic animal in certain tricks, such as teaching a dog to sit, fetch, stay, or heel; horses may be broken to a rider and so on. If used to attempt to calm a wild or hostile animal, a success will drive it off. If it is hungry or has young present however, this roll is two grades more difficult. Offering a hungry animal food may make the roll one or two Difficulty Grades easier or may make the animal start following the character to get more, depending on the circumstances.

### Arcane Casting (INT+POW)

Arcane Casting is a magical skill essential to Arcane Magic. It is the magic-user's ability to successfully cast spells previously memorized from a spell book or scroll. It also represents the caster finding the correct mental state to cast a spell, accompanying gestures and incantations and so on. Increasing competence in this skill also improves the final Intensity of any spells cast with it.

### Arcane Knowledge (INT x2)

Like Arcane Casting, this magical skill is essential to Arcane Magic. It represents a mage's actual accumulated spell knowledge, and is used when attempting to learn new spells, copy them into a spell book, create scrolls, identify a spell as it is being cast, and so on. It also determines the number of spells the caster may have in memory at any one time.

Arcane Knowledge is not only limited to Arcane casters. It may be adopted by those who simply wish to study the esoteric even if they do not actively practice Arcane Magic.

### Art (POW+CHA)

There are many specific art forms. Painting to Poetry; Literature to Sculpture. A character chooses an Art specialization when taking this skill. Subsequent Art forms are advanced separately. A roll is made whenever a character must impress or convince through his artistic medium.

### Bureaucracy (INT x2)

Understanding administrative procedures, records, and unspoken conventions are covered by the Bureaucracy skill. It is used to interact with officials or discover pertinent civic information. Depending on the sophistication of their culture, bureaucrats need not necessarily be literate. However, their Bureaucracy skill cannot exceed the score of the Language or Literacy skill in which they work. Whenever red-tape or administrative landscapes need to be navigated, a Bureaucracy roll is necessary.

### Channel (INT+CHA)

Channel is the magical skill used to call upon and conduit the power of the gods. Increasing competence in this skill also improves the final Intensity of any spells cast with it.

### Commerce (INT+CHA)

Commerce is used to evaluate the worth of goods and commodities and to trade them for the best possible price. It is also used to understand the intricacies of business transactions in addition to securing a profit. A further use is in finding the best way to dispose of stolen and illicit goods – again for the best possible price. Commerce is obviously used when trading and it can be Opposed by either an opponent's Commerce skill or Willpower, reflecting the opposing side's attempts to further the deal in their favor. It is also used to judge the market value of goods, gaining an idea of price, and where it will be best traded.

### Courtesy (INT+CHA)

This skill covers understanding how to act appropriately in a social or formal situation: modes of address, rituals, and conventions of behavior, and so forth. It includes everything from who to bow to and when, to how low; from when to use a particular title to when it is appropriate to act informally.

### Craft. (DEX+INT)

Each Craft. is a specialized form, and there are as many crafts as there are professions for them. Like Art, Craft. is used to create the subject item. How long it takes depends entirely on the nature of the product: weaving a rug takes longer than throwing a pot, for instance, but time is not necessarily the most important factor: it is the skill of the crafter, the quality of the resources and attention to detail.

### Culture (INT x2)

Culture is the more specific form of the Standard Skill of Customs, relating instead to societies foreign to the character's own. Each Culture skill must be given a particular nation or society to which it applies. Mechanically it works in the same way as the Customs skill.

### Devotion (POW+CHA)

Devotion is a magical skill which reflects the commitment of a cleric to the service of a deity. It not only measures the depth of devotion to a god, but also governs the Magnitude of any Divine spells called upon by the character. Additionally, the skill can indicate the standing of a Divine caster within a religious organization.

Devotion is not only limited to Divine casters. It may be adopted by those who simply wish to show respect to the gods even if they do not actively practice Divine magic.

### Disguise (INT+CHA)

Effecting a convincing disguise, using appropriate materials (costumes, cosmetics, wigs, or hairpieces), is covered by the Disguise skill. Creating the disguise requires time and attention to detail, as well as access to the right materials to make it convincing. If some, or all, of these elements are not present then the Disguise roll's Difficulty Grade is made one or more steps harder.

### Engineering (INT x2)

The design and building of large-scale structures, from houses to bridges, gates to siege engines, is in the remit of the Engineering skill. Rolls are necessary when planning large-scale projects to ensure correct construction but are also made when an engineer wants to assess a structure's integrity for whatever reason (state of repair or weak spots, for example).

### Gambling (INT+POW)

The Gambling skill measures a character's competence in games of chance and especially where money is staked on the outcome. It is used to assess the odds of success or failure or spot when someone is cheating. The skill can be used in an opposed or unopposed manner, depending on the situation. Spending the night in a faceless gambling den might only require a straight test, whereas a high stakes dice game involving notable personages may instead require several Rounds of Opposed Rolls.

### Healing (INT+POW)

Healing is the in-depth knowledge of medical procedures, based on cultural practices. In a Primitive or Barbarian culture, for instance, healing will be based on the knowledge of herbs and natural cures. In a Civilized culture, drugs and more advanced treatments will be more common. In all cultures Healing includes the ability to set bones, suture wounds, and so forth. Obviously applying Healing requires appropriate resources, and most practicing healers will have such things at hand (needles, gut or thread for sutures, herbs for poultices, and so forth).

### Intimidation (INT+CHA)

This skill is used to threaten an individual into a course of action they would otherwise be unwilling to take. It is often used to extract information from another, or to get an opponent to back down through the threat of physical violence. Intimidation checks may be modified based on the method used, and the opponent's perceived level of danger. Intimidation is typically Opposed by the victim's Willpower, however, if used with torture, Endurance may be applicable.

### Language (INT+CHA)

This skill covers the speaking and comprehension of languages other than the character's own. The Language skill is not rolled against directly but is treated as a static representation of overall fluency. Its value is used by the Games Master to limit the level of spoken interaction when the players converse with personalities in the game. Use the Linguistic Fluency table as a guideline.

##### Linguistic Fluency Table

| _ **Language %** _ | **Conversational Fluency** |
| --- | --- |
| _01-25%_ | Can understand only a few simple words, cannot phrase sentences, or read |
| _26-50%_ | Can understand and communicate in fragmentary, simple sentences, such as "Where is Temple?" or "How much food?" Can read at an elementary school level |
| _51-75%_ | Fluent enough for general conversation and can read at a high school level |
| _76%+_ | Able to express yourself with eloquence and can read at a college level |

Each Language skill is specific to a particular racial, national, or regional language, which must be chosen at the time of learning. It can also help to understand similar dialects which share a common linguistic basis or origin. Depending on the divergence, the skill roll should be treated at least one Difficulty Grade harder, possibly reducing the character's fluency.

The Language skill includes literacy. Literacy does not necessarily imply writing, as there are an infinite number of ways to record information. Some cultures might carve symbols into trees or lengths of bone, whereas others record history in complex patterns of knots in a tapestry. Neither are all forms of literacy based on phonetic alphabets; hieroglyphs and ideograms also being commonplace.

### Language (Thieves' Cant) (INT+CHA)

_Rogues Only_. Requires Oath to the Thieves' Guild to learn this patois at Base Level. This 'Language' skill consists of slang and implied meanings and is used between thieves to discuss pursuits of an illicit nature in public, without giving away information to other interested parties. This communication is limited to discussions about breaking and entering. Rogues that are long-term members of the Thieves Guild will automatically know this skill at Base Level +40%. Those that pick it up in play start at Base Level.

### Lockpicking (DEX x2)

Lockpicking is the ability to open a mechanical locking system without the aid of a key or other device made specifically for the lock. It includes the techniques of levering open bolted or barred doors and windows without causing damage. Lockpicking may also be used 'reverse pick a lock'; lock a door, chest, and so on, when no key is available.

### Lore (INT x2)

Lore covers a specific body of knowledge which must be chosen when the skill is first learned. Alchemy, Astrology, Astronomy, Geography, Heraldry, History, Midwifery, Mineral, Monsters, Politics, Religion, Strategy and Tactics: these are all typical examples of Lore skills. Skill in a Lore means the character understands its fundamentals, how it can be applied to immediate challenges and problems and can use the Lore to recall useful information.

### Mechanisms (DEX+INT)

Mechanisms represents the knowledge and skill to assemble and disassemble mechanical devices, such as traps. The skill of Mechanisms generally involves the creation of delicate contraptions with small working parts, as opposed to Engineering, which deals with massive constructions. It is a distinct discipline from Lockpicking and cannot be interchanged with that skill.

### Musicianship (DEX+CHA)

Musicianship covers the playing of musical instruments; from a simple reed pipe to a complex stringed instrument such as a harp, and each iteration of Musicianship is applied to a group of similar instruments. A musician who can play a reed pipe can also play a flute, panpipes, or a recorder because the fundamentals are the same. They could not, however, play a harp or lute.

### Navigation (INT+POW)

Whether using prominent landmarks, the stars, or the varying taste of seawater, the ability to accurately direct travel is covered by the Navigation skill. Each Navigation skill covers a specific region or environment, such as Open Seas or Underground for example. It should be made during unusual journeys or when in completely unfamiliar territory.

### Oratory (POW+CHA)

Oratory is the art of delivering a speech to a large group of people with the aim of conveying or swaying a point of view. It is a skill frequently used by politicians to drive home a policy but is also used by commanders to inspire troops and impose discipline on the battlefield. Wherever mass persuasion is needed, Oratory, rather than Influence, is used.

### Seamanship (INT+CON)

This skill is used in the same way as Boating (see page XX) but is instead applied to large waterborne vessels powered by sail or banks of oars. It also covers the maintenance and upkeep of a ship: assessing when repairs are needed, where it is safe to anchor, the dangers of violent weather, and so forth.

### Seduction (INT+CHA)

Seduction is the romantic or sexual persuasion of another person, a skill very different to Influence. It uses explicit signals – verbal and non-verbal – to elicit a sexually positive response. It also takes a significant amount of time: successful Seduction may take hours, days, or weeks to achieve depending on the morals of the target, who can always attempt to resist Seduction with Willpower.

### Sleight (DEX+CHA)

Sleight covers attempts to palm or conceal small objects (legerdemain and prestidigitation) and includes attempts to pick pockets, cut purses, or cause a visual distraction. Naturally, it is an essential thieves' skill.

### Streetwise (POW+CHA)

Streetwise represents knowledge of places and social contacts within a settlement. It covers everything from identifying potentially dangerous neighborhoods, to finding local services – legal or illegal. How long a Streetwise attempt takes depends on what is sought. Finding a good inn will take less time than locating a fence for stolen goods or a fake trading permit.

### Survival (CON+POW)

This skill covers surviving in a rural or wilderness environment where the benefits of civilization are absent: foraging, building a fire, finding shelter or a safe place to sleep. When properly equipped, rolls are usually unnecessary since the character may be carrying a tent, food supplies, and so on. Only when separated from their equipment or when environmental conditions turn bad does it become essential to utilize this skill. A roll is usually made once per day in such conditions.

### Track (INT+CON)

The Track skill is used for tracking any form of game or quarry. It uses both obvious and ambiguous signs of passing to remain on the quarry's trail, including footprints, bruised leaves, scattered pollen, displaced rocks, and so on; small, tell-tale signs that are invisible to the non-skilled. Track rolls need to be made periodically, especially if conditions change abruptly (a rain shower, for example, will disturb certain signs). How often depends on how cunning the quarry has been. Conceal rolls can be used to oppose a Track roll.

## Skill Rules for Different Circumstances and Situations

Although the basic rules for using skills in Classic Fantasy Imperative are very straightforward, there are a multitude of different circumstances that arise during play that require skills to be handled in a slightly different way. The following sections look at these circumstances and situations and show how to handle them.

### Reattempting Skills

In some situations, a character will Fail a skill attempt but be left. in a situation where they could potentially try again. Example cases might be picking a lock or attempting to climb a sheer wall. Instead of simply denying any further attempts, kindly Games Masters may permit a follow-up, last-ditch attempt. However, the character will suffer some trepidation or lack of confidence which increases the Difficulty Grade of the skill roll by one.

If this second effort also ends in failure, the character is assumed to have given it his 'best shot' and cannot make any further attempts for the foreseeable future.

### Opposed Rolls

Skills are frequently against other skills – Stealth versus Perception when a rogue attempts to cut a nobleman's purse, say; or Deceit versus Insight when the same rogue tries to deny the attempt when she is caught – are good examples of times where skills are matched against each other. These are known as Opposed Rolls and are used where a challenge will result in either win or lose, pass or fail.

- An Opposed Roll is determined thus: both participants roll their respective skills. The winner is the one who gains the better Level of Success. If the participants score the same Level of Success (a Standard Success each, or a Critical each), then the winner is the one who has the highest dice roll still within the success range of the skill.

If both participants Fail in an Opposed Roll, then either:

- Describe the situation, leaving both sides hanging in dramatic tension, then re-roll the contest to establish a winner.
- The Games Master should produce some explanation or circumstances that suit the nature of the failure.

Opposed Rolls are frequently used in certain battle situations to overcome the effects of wounds or oppose a combat Special Effect. They are also used to resist poisons and disease or shrug off the effects of baleful magic.

##### Opposed Roll Examples Table

| _ **Activity** _ | **Opposed Skill Examples** |
| --- | --- |
| _Bargaining/Haggling_ | Commerce vs. Commerce, Influence vs. Commerce |
| _Chasing/Racing_ | Athletics vs. Athletics, Athletics vs. Endurance, Ride vs. Ride |
| _Deceiving or Lying_ | Deceit vs. Insight, Sleight vs. Perception |
| _Displaying Loyalty_ | Passion vs. Passion, Passion vs. Insight, Passion vs. Influence |
| _Getting out of the Way_ | Evade vs. Athletics, Evade vs. Mechanisms, Evade vs. Ride |
| _Hiding or Sneaking_ | Stealth vs. Perception; Stealth vs. Track |
| _Pulling Rank_ | Influence vs. Willpower, Deceit vs. Willpower |
| _Staying the Course_ | Endurance vs. Endurance, Endurance vs. Brawn |
| _Swaying a Crowd_ | Oratory vs. Willpower |
| _Test of Strength_ | Brawn vs. Brawn, Brawn vs. Endurance |
| _Test of Wills_ | Willpower vs. Willpower, Seduction vs. Willpower |

### Differential Rolls

Differential Rolls are like Opposed Rolls except that instead of a simple win or lose result, the difference in Levels of Success is calculated. Primarily used for the resolution of combat, Differential Rolls can also be used in other situations where the Games Master wishes to increase the detailed results of a contest.

A Differential Roll is determined in the following manner: Both participants roll against their respective skills and suffer the results of their roll as if tested in isolation. There is not an outright 'winner' per se, but whoever gained the higher Level of Success gains an advantage equal to the difference in the success levels between them (assuming one participant gains at least a Standard success or better). If both participants score the same Level of Success (a Standard success each, or a Critical each), then there is no additional effect.

##### Differential Roll Results Table

| _ **Result of Rolls** _ | **Antagonist Critical** | **Antagonist Success** | **Antagonist Failure** | **Antagonist Fumble** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _Protagonist Critical_ | No Benefit | Protagonist Wins 1 Level of Success | Protagonist Wins 2 Levels of Success | Protagonist Wins 3 Levels of Success |
| _Protagonist Success_ | Antagonist Wins 1 Level of Success | No Benefit | Protagonist Wins 1 Level of Success | Protagonist Wins 2 Levels of Success |
| _Protagonist Failure_ | Antagonist Wins 2 Levels of Success | Antagonist Wins 1 Level of Success | No Benefit | No Benefit |
| _Protagonist Fumble_ | Antagonist Wins 3 Levels of Success | Antagonist Wins 2 Levels of Success | No Benefit | No Benefit |

### Opposed Skills Over 100%

If the highest skilled participant in an Opposed or Differential Roll has a skill more than 100%, that participant subtracts the difference between 100 and his skill value from the skill of everyone in the contest, including himself. This reduces the skill value of the opponents but leaves him retaining the advantage.

The identification of who has the highest skill must be calculated after any other modifiers for circumstances have been applied.

# Chapter 6: Money and Equipment

This chapter is concerned with money: how much characters have and what it buys. Classic Fantasy Imperative uses the Gold Piece (GP) as the standard unit of currency in the game, with the cost of most equipment, goods and services being measured in GP. One GP is the standard price for one day's food, drink, and accommodation for one person living a modest lifestyle.

It therefore costs a character living a modest lifestyle around 7 GP a week personally to live at subsistence level. Depending on where the characters are located, coinage may not even be used (or may be viewed with suspicion). Some cultures value barter and payment in kind more favorably than the chink of gold.

The standard currency for Classic Fantasy Imperative consists of the Copper, Silver, Gold, and Platinum Piece. The exchange rate is:

### Standard Exchange Rates Table

| _ **Coin** _ | **CP** | **SP** | **GP** | **PP** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _Copper Piece (CP)_ | 1 | 1/10 | 1/100 | 1/1000 |
| _Silver Piece (SP)_ | 10 | 1 | 1/10 | 1/50 |
| _Gold Piece (GP)_ | 100 | 10 | 1 | 1/2 |
| _Platinum Piece (PP)_ | 1,000 | 100 | 10 | 1 |

Usually where the price of an item or service price consists of coins of different value, it will be displayed with a decimal: 1.5 GP would be 1 gold and 5 silver, as 5 silver is half of a gold piece. Likewise, 3.5 SP would be 3 silver and 5 copper.

Some cultures, typically farming, nomad, and barbarian communities, measure wealth in terms of livestock. A single large herd animal, such as a cow, is worth around 10 GP. A pig or sheep is worth around 2.5 GP (2 GP, 5 SP) and a flock of hens around 1.5 GP (1 GP, 5 SP). Others like orcs, goblins, and other humanoid races, may have little actual use for coinage within their own community, however, know it's worth to the civilized races and therefore can usually be found in possession of coinage as well.

## Encumbrance

Classic Fantasy Imperative does not need detailed encumbrance rules if the Games Master deems them unnecessary. Instead, a character can carry a number of 'Things' up to their STR Characteristic. A 'thing' is defined as something of weight, volume, or substance. Example Things are:

- A single-handed melee weapon or buckler shield (2H weapons and all other shields count as 2 Things; small weapons such as daggers count as half a Thing)
- A light or heavy bow or a light crossbow (heavy crossbows and light repeating crossbows count as 2 Things); a sling counts as half a Thing.
- Quiver (can carry 20 arrows or bolts at no additional weight)
- Fully laden backpack (of up to 10 Things at no additional weight)
- Fully laden sack (counts as 2 Things and can carry up to 10 Things or 1,000 coins). Collapsible containers, such as sacks and pouches, may only be carried in other containers when empty.
- Spell book, grimoire, or tome
- Basic tool kit (hammer, chisel, file, stakes, spikes, and so on; or a Rogue's toolkit)
- Purse or pouch containing 1 Thing, 100 coins, or 20 sling stones, or 10 lead sling bullets at no additional weight.
- Weeks' worth of rations
- Full water skin
- Every full 50 coins of any denomination weigh the equivalent of Half a 'Thing.'
- Assume that 1 SIZ is equal to 3 'Things'.

Every additional Thing above a character's STR reduces the character's Initiative Bonus by 1. Every 6 Things above STR reduces the character's Movement Rate by 5 feet. Finally, when more Things are carried than the character's STR, skills using STR or DEX as part of their Base are 1 grade more difficult. When more Things are carried than twice the character's STR, these skills are 2 grades more difficult.

Armor Encumbrance: For simplicity, worn armor does not count toward Things carried for characters proficient in, and accustomed to the armor they wear. However, for characters not proficient in armor, or in the case of additional armor pieces being carried, they have a value of 1 Thing per Hit Location for light armor, and 2 Things per Hit Location for heavy. Thus, a full suit of light armor being worn by someone without training, or carried by anyone, is a total of 7 Things, and a full suit of heavy armor is a total of 14. On top of that, a full suit of heavy armor will not even fit in a backpack.

Games Masters should apply common sense. It should be obvious that even the strongest human character cannot wander around carrying eight different weapons, spare armor, full traveling gear, a barrel of beer, and enough gold to ransom a kingdom.

## Equipment

This section is given over to equipment: armor, weapons, clothing, tools, and other sundries characters rely on when adventuring. Any piece of equipment is described in terms of one or more elements (some apply more than others). These are:

- Cost (in GP, SP, or CP)
- Armor Points: the natural resilience of the item to damage
- Hit Points: how much damage the item can sustain before being destroyed or rendered useless.

### Equipment Price

All items listed in this chapter represent standard quality examples. Items of better or worse quality are available at either an inflated or reduced cost. The prices quoted assume availability is good. When there is a short supply of something, prices will rise and, depending on the commodity, may be anywhere between 10% and 1000% higher than quoted (1d100x10%). The environment, too, will affect availability and therefore cost. Items and commodities are easier and cheaper to obtain in larger settlements with established markets and traders. In remote or rural areas, all but the most basic of locally produced goods and foodstuffs will be more difficult to obtain; and will command a higher price, if available at all.

### Silver Weapons

Metal weapons may be made of pure silver so that they may harm creatures such as lycanthropes. Figure the cost of a silver weapon as being ten times more expensive than normal, unless specified otherwise. Silver weapons possess 1 less Armor Point and 2 less Hit Points. They also do one less point of damage against foes wearing Armor (thus a silver dagger inflicts 1d4 damage instead of 1d4+1).

## Melee Weapons

All weapons are governed by a series of Characteristics which are as follows:

- **Type** : Whether the weapon is classed as a basic or martial weapon.
- **Hands** : The number of hands required to properly wield the weapon.
- **Damage** : The amount of damage the weapon delivers if an attack is successful.
- **Size** : Every weapon is rated for its mass, leverage, and stability. The Size is used to determine the weapon's ability to inflict and Parry damage (see page XX). The size categories are Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), Huge (H), and Enormous (E).
- **Combat Effects** : The design of the weapon allows it access to weapon specific Special Effects. Swords, for instance, slice and stab, and so are permitted access to the Impale and Bleed effects, whereas a mace is unable to produce those effects but could inflict Stun Location instead (see Special Effects page XX).
- **AP/HP** : All weapons are rated for their Armor Points and Hit Points; their ability to withstand direct damage and how much damage they can tolerate before breaking. Those weapons that rely on metal for their damage capability are assumed to be either bronze or iron.
- **Traits** : Some weapons, due to their specialized nature, have certain qualities, or traits, which differentiate them from weapons of a similar style. The common traits are:
  - _Barbed_ – If impaled it will cause full rather than half damage on being yanked free.
  - _Entrapping_ – If used to Parry an attacking weapon, that weapon is considered one size smaller than it is. So, a Large sword is considered Medium and a Medium sword is considered Small. Weapons already Small in size are unaffected.
  - _Flexible_ – If the opponent is using a shield to Parry, the shield is considered one size smaller than it is. So, a Huge shield is considered Large, a Large shield is considered Medium, and so on.
  - _Mount_ – The weapon must be used from the back of a moving mount.
  - _Passive Block_ – The weapon can passively block multiple Hit Locations, which must be contiguous to one another.
  - _Ranged Parry_ – The weapon can Parry Ranged Weapons.
  - _Set_ – The weapon can be set to receive a foot or mounted charge.
  - _Stealth_ – The weapon must be used from ambush.
  - _Thrown_ – The weapon can be used as a Ranged Weapon as well as a hand-to-hand weapon.
- **Cost** : The weapon's cost in Gold and/or Silver Pieces. 2.5 GP would be 2 gold and 5 silver.
- **Encumbrance** : Unless specified otherwise, all melee weapons are equivalent to 1 'Thing.'

\*\*\* A whip may not typically be used to Parry. However, if it is currently rolled up and in hand, the Games Master may choose to allow it at Formidable difficulty. Rolling the whip takes 1 Combat Round. Therefore, it is generally impossible to Parry with it in the same round after it has been used.

## Ranged Weapons

Ranged Weapons are difficult to defend against. Without a shield or other form of solid cover that can disperse the energy of a projectile, Ranged Weapons cannot be parried, meaning that the best defense, if one is aware of an incoming missile, is evasion. However, evasion often puts the defendant into a situation were returning an attack, even a ranged one, is difficult.

Ranged Weapons have similar characteristics to Melee Weapons, although there are some differences as noted below:

- **Damage** : The amount of damage the weapon delivers if an attack is successful.
- **Damage Modifier** : Not all Ranged Weapons can take advantage of a character's Damage Modifier. A Yes or No entry dictates whether the user's Damage Modifier can be applied.
- **Force** : Each Ranged Weapon possesses a force rating equivalent to the 'Size' of close combat weapons. In the case of projectiles, this does not relate to the firing weapon itself, but rather to how much 'impact' its ammunition has. The value is used to determine whether the weapon can overcome any shield which may Parry it. The size categories are Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), Huge (H), and Enormous (E).
- **Range** : This is a measure of the weapon's effectiveness at three distances separated by slashes, representing the maximum Close, Effective, and Long ranges of the weapon or its ammunition. Ranges are expressed in feet. Note that distance penalties to the user's skill are independent of the weapon.
  - **Close Range** – The distance over which Choose Location may be used as a non-Critical Special Effect, provided the target is stationary or unaware of the impending attack.
  - **Effective Range** – The distance over which there are no significant modifiers on the weapon's accuracy or power.
  - **Long Range** – The distance over which the weapon can still inflict harm, but the amount of damage is halved, and its Force is reduced by one step.
- **Load** : This shows how many Turns are required to load or reload a weapon which fires ammunition.
- **Combat Effects** : As per Close Combat weapons.
- **Imp. Size** : The effective size of the weapon or its ammunition if it succeeds in an impaling attack.
- **AP/HP** : All weapons are rated for their Armor Points and Hit Points; their ability to withstand direct damage and how much damage they can tolerate before breaking. Those weapons that rely on metal for their damage capability are assumed to be either bronze or iron.
- **Traits** : Some weapons, due to their specialized nature, have certain qualities, or traits, which differentiate them from weapons of a similar style. The common traits are:
  - **1H** – This weapon may be fired one-handed, allowing a melee weapon or shield to be carried in the other hand.
  - **Dwarf** – This weapon is only common in dwarf society.
  - **Repeating** – This weapon holds a clip of 5 bolts and may fire one per Action. It requires 3 Combat Actions to reload a fresh bolt "clip," and 1 minute to reload a spent bolt clip with 5 more bolts.
- **Cost** : The weapon's cost in Silver Pieces.
- **Encumbrance** : Unless specified otherwise, all Ranged Weapons are equivalent to 1 'Thing.'

### Ranged Weapon Ammunition

Weapons such as bows and crossbows use ammunition to deliver damage. Arrows, bolts, darts, and bullets can be made by anyone with the appropriate craft. skill, for example Craft. (Fletcher) for arrows, if the appropriate raw materials and a suitable work area or workshop are available for the task. All ammunition is sold in quantities totaling 1 'Thing.'

##### Ranged Weapon Ammunition

| _ **Ammo Type** _ | **Description/Game Effects** | **Cost** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _Arrows (20)_ | — | 5 SP |
| _Crossbow bolts (20)_ | — | 5 SP |
| _Lead sling bullets (10)_ | — | 1 SP |
| _Sling stone_ | Stones are easily acquired; however, tend to do one grade less damage and have a reduced range compared to bullets. Range categories are reduced by half | — |

## Armor

Armor reduces the amount of damage a Hit Location sustains by its Armor Point value. For example, Ring Mail has 3 Armor Points and so reduces any damage by the same amount. A dagger strike for 3 points of damage would be completely blocked, for example. The downside to armor is that it can be heavy and restrictive to movement; fighting for a sustained period in metal armor takes its toll in terms of Fatigue and slows down the ability to react.

No matter what material armor is made of it cannot be layered with other types – such concepts are already incorporated as part of its construction. Armor is assumed to come with whatever lining or padding would normally be expected as part of the complete panoply.

Each type of armor is defined by the following qualities:

**AP:** The number of Armor Points given to each location covered by this armor.

**Cost:** The cost, in Gold Pieces, per location covered.

**Encumbrance:** Worn armor does not count toward 'Things' carried for characters proficient in, and accustomed to the armor they wear. However, for characters not proficient in armor, or in the case of additional armor pieces being carried, they have a value of 1 'Thing' per Hit Location for light armor, and 2 'Things' per Hit Location for heavy. Thus, a full suit of light armor being worn by someone without training, or carried by anyone, is a total of 7 'Things,' and a full suit of heavy armor is a total of 14.

## Magic Scrolls, Potions, and Elixirs (Common)

Every city, as well as most large towns, will have at least one shop dedicated to the sale of expendable magic items; and roadside vendors may be found set up in even the smallest of hamlets. A limited number of common scrolls, potions, and elixirs may be purchased at exotic magic shops, temples, and even some adventurer shops. These only represent those most likely to be available, and not in great numbers. Stock is typically replenished every couple of days in large towns and cities, and weekly in smaller settlements. The Games Master may decide the chance of finding rarer magic items on a case-by-case basis. All scrolls, potions, and elixirs are equivalent to ½ of a 'Thing'

# Chapter 7: Game System

Many different things can occur during a _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ game. Some are resolved through skill use or one of the major game mechanics such as combat or magic; others require their own rules for adjudication. This chapter provides rules and guidance for a variety of different scenarios that players will encounter while playing the game.

The list is not exhaustive but should represent the most common situations. If Games Masters find there are other situations that require some form of game system adjudication, and that these situations seem to occur frequently, then they are encouraged to develop their own rules to cover these special circumstances, using those given in this chapter as a basis for replication or development.

## Aging

All characters age, and with age come certain consequences. The signs of Aging start at Early Middle Age (40 years for humans – other species age at greater or lesser rates as shown below). As a character passes into a new Aging Band, they must make both an Endurance roll and a Willpower roll at the Difficulty Grades noted. If a roll is Failed, then he or she experiences Aging Effects as shown in the Aging Effects table.

Each Characteristic affected by Aging reduces by 1d3 points. These points can be recovered or at least partially counteracted through Characteristic improvement, representing efforts made to keep themselves trim and alert as they grow older. If any Characteristic is reduced to zero from Aging, the character dies due to his terminal frailty. Once a character reaches the Dotage Age Band, Aging rolls are made yearly regardless of race.

What specific debilitating effects arise as part of the Aging process are up to the Games Master to define. For instance, reducing STR, CON, or DEX represents general wear and tear on the body, with creaking joints and a gradual loss of mobility. Reducing INT indicates that age is starting to play tricks on the mind and memory, while reducing CHA indicates the character is getting craggier, and perhaps more short-tempered, as they get older.

##### Age Bands

| _ **Age Band** _ | **Human** | **Dwarf** | **Elf** | **Gnome** | **½ Elf** | **½ Orc** | **Halfling** | **Endurance and Willpower Roll Grade** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _Early Middle Age_ | 40-49 | 150-199 | 500-624 | 300-379 | 50-99 | 30-39 | 70-89 | Easy |
| _Middle Age_ | 50-59 | 200-249 | 625-749 | 380-459 | 100-149 | 40-49 | 90-109 | Standard |
| _Late Middle Age_ | 60-69 | 250-299 | 750-874 | 460-539 | 150-199 | 50-59 | 110-129 | Hard |
| _Old Age_ | 70-79 | 300-349 | 875-999 | 540-619 | 200-249 | 60-69 | 130-149 | Formidable |
| _Advanced Old Age_ | 80-89 | 350-399 | 1000-1124 | 620-699 | 250-299 | 70-79 | 150-169 | Herculean |
| _Dotage_ | 90+ | 400+ | 1125+ | 700+ | 300+ | 80+ | 170+ | Hopeless |

##### Aging Effects Table

| _ **1d6** _ | **Physical Aging (Failed Endurance)** | **Mental Aging (Failed Willpower)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _1-2_ | STR | INT |
| _3-4_ | CON | POW |
| _5-6_ | DEX | CHA |

## Asphyxiation

Characters can hold their breath for a number of seconds equal to their Endurance skill. However, the character must be prepared (filling the lungs with as much air as possible); if not, then the period is halved if the character was in a passive situation, or reduced to one-fifth if the character was engaged in strenuous activity.

Once the period of held breath is over, characters must make an Endurance roll:

- If the roll is a Critical Success, no further deterioration occurs.
- If the roll is Successful, the character accrues an extra level of Fatigue.
- If the roll Fails, the character sustains 1d2 extra levels of Fatigue that Round.
- If the roll is Fumbled, the character sustains 1d3 extra levels of Fatigue that Round.

Without aid, death from Asphyxiation is usually swift. If the Asphyxiation ends before the character dies, they recover Fatigue levels lost to suffocation relatively quickly, regaining one level per minute.

Depending on the method of Asphyxiation, the Games Master may wish to prevent full recovery, imposing an enduring level of Fatigue to represent damage to the lungs caused by smoke or water inhalation.

## Character Improvement

Every _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ character can improve with time and experience. Improvement can be undertaken in several areas:

- Increasing existing skills
- Increasing Passions
- Learning new skills
- Learning new Abilities

### Experience Rolls

The mechanism for most character improvement is the Experience Roll. Games Masters dispense Experience Rolls at an appropriate juncture in the campaign: at the end of every successful scenario or storyline; or after perhaps two or three sessions of play if the story is a long one which will take time to complete. The frequency is at the Games Master's discretion. A high frequency of Experience Rolls will lead to the characters developing at a faster rate.

There is no right or wrong time to give Experience Rolls, but natural breaks in the story may suggest suitable times. The Games Master is, however, always the decision maker here. While players cannot demand Experience Rolls, they have a right to expect them at certain times – as their characters will not be able to develop without them.

The number of Experience Rolls awarded is also determined by the Games Master. However, a good rule of thumb is 1-3 Experience Rolls per session since the last time they were awarded.

### Increasing Existing Skills

Any skill on the Character Sheet, Standard or Professional, can be increased by spending one Experience Roll. Players can elect _not_ to spend Experience Rolls on increasing skills, instead building up a stockpile for use in increasing other things – such as Class abilities (see below).

- The player rolls 1d100 and compares it to the skill being increased. The character's INT is added to the roll.
- If the number rolled is **equal to or greater** than the skill being improved, it increases by 1d4+1%.
- If the number rolled is **less than** the skill selected, the skill still increases, but only by 1%.
- If a character Fumbled any skill during the preceding session(s) – i.e., between the last set of Experience Rolls and the present one – the Fumbled skill gains a free increase of 1%. It is a truism that we learn more from our mistakes than our successes and this represents the reflection a character undergoes following a disastrous failure. Multiple Fumbles of the same skill do not stack. In a case where the Fumbled skill is also being raised with an Experience Roll, the 1% from the Fumble is applied before the roll is made to improve it.

The same skill may not benefit from more than one Experience Roll per session.

### Increasing Passions

As described under Passions on page XX, the value of a Passion may be increased with Experience Rolls in the same way as a skill. If supported by play, the Games Master might even allow a Passion to be reduced using an Experience Roll.

For example, constant spurning from an unrequited love might eventually wear down the Passion of even the most ardent lover, especially one who wishes to pursue a relationship without the ghosts of the past haunting them.

### Learning New Skills

Some characters may wish to study new Professional Skills which they never had the chance to learn from their culture or Class. Before they can start investing Experience Rolls, they must first find a source of knowledge from which to learn. This could be as prosaic as a professional tutor such those provided by orders or guilds. Alternately it might be a more exotic source of education such as an ancient and crumbling training scroll.

Once a source of education is found, the character must spend an entire month of study and practice to garner a basic grounding in that skill (learn at Base Level). This costs 3 Experience Rolls plus whatever in-game costs are required to pay the teacher (if one exists) and purchase (or rent) whatever equipment and tools may be needed.

### Learning New Class Abilities

Assuming the character meets the requisite Rank and skill level, if any, one or more Experience Rolls may be expended to gain or improve Class Abilities. This is detailed in Chapter 3: Classes under the relevant Class write-ups. Unlike skills, this typically does not require finding a source of knowledge from which to learn the relevant Ability, as it assumes gaining advanced techniques through the repeated use of any requisite skills. The cost in Experience Rolls is equal to the character's current Rank and many Abilities are locked out until a specific Rank is attained.

## Falling

The amount of damage suffered in a fall depends on the distance of the drop. Armor Points do not reduce falling damage, but the Damage Modifier of the falling character or creature applies to damage rolls.

##### Falling Distance Table

| 5 feet or less | No damage. |
| --- | --- |
| 6 to 15 feet | 1d6 points of damage to one random location. |
| 16 to 30 feet | 2d6 points of damage to two random locations. |
| 31 to 45 feet | 3d6 points of damage to three random locations. |
| 46 to 60 feet | 4d6 points of damage to four random locations. |
| Each +15 feet | +1d6 damage. |

## Falling Objects

A falling object imparts an amount of damage based on its SIZ and the distance of the fall. An object imparts 1d6 damage for every 6 points of SIZ (or fraction thereof), plus an amount of damage equal to the Damage Taken column of the Falling Distance Table – including any reductions for objects of smaller size.

## Fatigue

Fatigue measures tiredness and its incremental effects. It is used to track many different things, from strenuous activity to the debilitating effects of disease.

The primary way of accruing Fatigue is by engaging in some form of physical activity. The more arduous the exercise or work, the more quickly it tires the character. At the Games Master's discretion, characters must make an appropriate skill roll – either Athletics, Brawn, or Endurance – to resist gaining a level of Fatigue.

Every Failed roll accrues a level of Fatigue. Each level of Fatigue carries penalties for skill use, movement, Initiative, and Action Points. Asphyxiation, Blood Loss, and other setting dependent effects also contribute to Fatigue Accrual.

For most characters, activities of any kind become near impossible when the level of Incapacitated is reached. At this stage, the character is still conscious but incapable of anything but the most desperate of activities.

Beyond Incapacitated, characters cannot act at all. The Fatigue levels – Semi-Conscious, Comatose, and Dead – are generally reserved for measuring the most extreme effects of suffocation, disease, blood loss, starvation, exposure, and so forth.

### Recovering from Fatigue

Characters recover from Fatigue depending on their Healing Rate. The amount of complete rest needed to recover from each level of accrued Fatigue is equal to the Recovery Period divided by the character's Healing Rate.

Note that the table represents Fatigue recovery for physical exertion. Fatigue recovery can be much faster when recovering from Asphyxiation or slower if recuperating from Blood Loss.

##### Fatigue Levels

|
 | Skill Grade | Movement | Initiative | Action Points | Recovery Period |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fresh | – | – | No Penalties | – | – |
| Winded | Hard | No Penalties | No Penalties | No Penalties | 15 minutes |
| Tired | Hard | -5 feet | No Penalties | No Penalties | 3 hours |
| Wearied | Formidable | -5 feet | -2 | No Penalties | 6 hours |
| Exhausted | Formidable | Halved | -4 | -1 | 12 hours |
| Debilitated | Herculean | Halved | -6 | -2 | 18 hours |
| Incapacitated | Herculean | Immobile | -8 | -3 | 24 hours |
| Semi-Conscious | Hopeless | No Activities Possible | No Activities Possible | No Activities Possible | 36 hours |
| Comatose | No Activities Possible | No Activities Possible | No Activities Possible | No Activities Possible | 48 hours |
| Dead | Dead | – | – | – | Never |

## Fires

Fires are always a source of danger when used as a weapon or rage out of control. The Fire Intensity table below gives five different intensities for heat damage, with some examples. The damage inflicted per Round is given in the Damage column. Being relatively small, Intensity 1 and 2 sources apply their damage to a single Hit Location, usually the one touching the source. Intensity 3 and 4 sources are larger, applying damage to nearest 1d4+1 Hit Locations, indicating the degree of radiant heat. Intensity 5 sources affect all Hit Locations simultaneously. Fire can ignite flammable materials. If not extinguished immediately such materials combust within a number of Rounds as indicated by the fire's Intensity. Once ignited, flammable materials burn until physically extinguished. Damage is applied directly to the Hit Points of the material, ignoring Armor Points, and to any flesh beneath. If left Uncontrolled, it spreads to a number of Hit Locations, per Round, equal to its Intensity.

##### Fire Intensity Table

| Intensity | Examples | Time to Ignite | Damage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Candle | 1d4 | 1d2 |
| 2 | Torch | 1d3 | 1d4 |
| 3 | Campfire | 1d2 | 1d6 |
| 4 | Room filling conflagration | 1d2 | 2d6 |
| 5 | Volcanic lava | Instant | 3d6 |

Fire-based attacks typically have a percentage chance of igniting flammable materials as they are generally over in a single Round. Unless otherwise noted, this chance is damage rolled x5% for fire-based attacks, and damage rolled x1% for electrical. Once ignited, flammable materials burn for 1d3-1 damage every Round until physically extinguished. Apply this damage directly to the Hit Points of the material, ignoring Armor Points, and to any flesh beneath. A creature's natural armor offers its normal protection, however. The victim may attempt to smother the flames by dropping prone and making a successful Athletics roll, which requires an Action Point and may be attempted each Turn. If others assist in smothering the flames in some way, the roll is one Difficulty Grade easier. If the damage roll results in zero damage, the fire has gone out on its own in that one location. For each location that had gone out on its own, the roll to smother the flames is also one Difficulty Grade easier.

## Game Time

In _Classic Fantasy Imperative_, time is an important factor, mostly to determine what happens in what order, so that game mechanics are applied when they should be. Remember that in-game time is usually not equivalent to time spent playing. Sometimes, the GM may need to summarize the events of many days in a single sentence, such as 'It takes you a week to reach Castle Greymyr,' while at other times, particularly during combat, the actions of only a few seconds of time can take several minutes or longer to resolve.

On a related note: Some spells, items, or effects are noted as being usable one or more times per day. An easy way to track this instead of keeping a log of when each such action took place, is to assume the clock resets after the character has had a full night's sleep. Therefore, using a magic item twice that is usable three times per day, will have all uses restored when the character next wakes, even if it was used just before they went to bed the night before.

Following are the important distinctions of game time:

### Combat Rounds

A Combat Round represents five seconds of real time. They are used to measure short, frenetic bursts of activity that take moments to complete or measuring very detailed activities that require a blow-by-blow resolution. For example, a chase between hunter and prey where each Round determines the twists and turns of the pursuit.

### Exploration Rounds

An Exploration Round represents five minutes of real time and allows the party to move at three times their Base Movement Rate (60 feet for humans and human-sized demi-humans, 45 feet for the smaller demi-human races). Exploration Rounds are typically used to measure movement in a dungeon, where it is important to maintain a high level of caution. The characters are moving slow, alert for traps and ambushes, and attempting to maintain stealth. This also assumes someone in the party is mapping. If no one is mapping, Exploration Rounds may be treated as one minute long. Using Exploration Rounds allows your Perception rolls to be made without penalty, however, as normal, other penalties may apply. Enemies find it one grade more difficult to detect a party at exploration speeds unless you are using light sources in areas of darkness (such as torches or lanterns), which would give you away. If characters decide to throw caution to the wind, you can move through the dungeon using Combat Rounds. However, in this case, Perception rolls are one grade harder, and enemies do not suffer a Perception Penalty with regards to detecting the characters. Note that when using a battle mat that reveals the entire dungeon to the players, or when the Games Master is drawing the dungeon out for them, it should **always** be assumed that the party is mapping, and therefore moving at exploration speed.

### Skill Time

Skill Time represents a few minutes to a few hours and is used to measure activities that do not require the detailed attention of a Combat Round but require a specific deliberation of effort with a definite result. Picking a lock might take five minutes, whereas observing the patrols made by teams of guards around a castle's walls might require several hours and are both examples of Skill Time.

### Narrative Time

This is the amount of time taken when the Games Master is narrating to the players, or when the players are discussing. Unless there is a specific reason for it, most actual roleplaying takes place in narrative time. When roleplaying, narrative time resembles real time, where a conversation takes as long to have as it takes to play. If a game session includes lengthy travel, or periods of activity where exact time is not of the essence, then time is compressed greatly to a few moments of game time.

### Short Rests

A Short Rest represents a period of about 15 minutes where the adventurers stop to catch their breath, doing nothing more strenuous than reading, eating, drinking, praying, and tending to wounds. The party decides how long to rest, and then performs the relevant 15-minute actions, with each player performing one before moving on to the next. There is no limit to the number of Short Rests that the party may take over the course of a day, and typically several rest actions are performed after setting camp, as well as in the morning before setting out. Each 15-minute Rest Action is detailed below and can be taken more than once unless stated otherwise.

- _ **Eat a Ration:** _ This 15-minute Rest Action may be taken only once per day as rations are tracked as a daily item and removes **any** one level of Fatigue no greater than Exhausted, as well as quells any hunger. Characters may reduce their Fatigue by a further level after eating if not greater than Winded, due to this being a non-strenuous activity.
- _ **Pray to a Deity or Study spell book:** _Regain 1 Magic Point per 15-minute Rest Action spent in prayer or study. Characters may reduce their Fatigue by one level if not greater than Winded due to this being a non-strenuous activity.
- _ **Tend to wounds:** _ Spend a 15-minute Rest Action using the First Aid skill, or four 15-minute rest actions (an hour) using the Healing skill.
- _ **Cast one or more spells:** _ Any number of spells may be cast to heal or buff the members of the party during a 15-minute Rest Action, limited to available Magic Points.
- _ **Prepare a new spell:** _ Following a sleep period of at least 8 hours, a spellcaster may usea 15-minute Rest Action to memorize, or forget, an Arcane or Divine spell, subject to the restrictions detailed on page XX under Memorizing Spells.
- _ **Dither:** _ This is the default 15-minute Rest Action unless another Action is chosen. The character simply wastes 15 minutes doing nothing useful. This Rest Action is typically performed if other members of the party are still performing rest actions and you have nothing to do. Characters may reduce their Fatigue by one level if not greater than Winded due to this being a non-strenuous activity.

## Hit Locations

Most successful (weapon) attacks land on a specific Hit Location. This can be determined randomly or in some circumstances be selected by Special Effects such as Choose Location. To randomly calculate which location is been hit, roll 1d20 and compare the number rolled with the relevant humanoid or creature Hit Location table.

Animals and monsters usually have slightly different Hit Location tables than humanoids to reflect their own unique physiology. These are listed as part of each being's description and are typically only of use to the Games Master.

The humanoid Hit Location table is repeated here for ease of reference.

##### Humanoid Hit Locations

| 1d20 | Hit Location |
| --- | --- |
| 1-3 | Right Leg |
| 4-6 | Left. Leg |
| 7-9 | Abdomen |
| 10-12 | Chest |
| 13-15 | Right Arm |
| 16-18 | Left. Arm |
| 19-20 | Head |

Note that some attacks, especially magical ones, or those produced by particular monsters (a red dragon's fiery breath for example), may strike several Hit Locations simultaneously. Individual Hit Locations may be armored, either from worn protection or the natural toughness of the creature's outer surface. This is important when considering Damage and Wound Levels below.

### Damage and Wound Levels

If an attack strikes successfully, it causes damage according to the damage rating for the weapon (see the statistical entries for close combat and Ranged Weapons in the Money& Equipment chapter, Chapter 6). A shortsword, for instance, inflicts 1d6 damage.

The rolled damage for the weapon or attack is modified by the certain conditions in the specific following order:

- Apply the Damage Modifier for the character making the attack.
- Modify the damage from any weapon enhancing (or reducing) magic.
- If parried, reduce the damage appropriately as per the comparative weapon sizes.
- If the Hit Location is armored, reduce damage by the Armor Points value.

If the damage inflicted by the attack is above zero, then the Hit Location sustains that amount of damage, with the damage total being immediately removed from the location's Hit Points. Note how many Hit Points the location has remaining, and the wound category that results.

- **Minor Wound:** Hit Location still has positive Hit Points.
- **Serious Wound:** Hit Location is reduced to zero Hit Points or below.
- **Major Wound:** Hit Location is reduced to a negative score equal to or greater than its starting Hit Points.

Use the following rules if a location receives a Serious or Major Wound. Note that wounds requiring Endurance checks test them in an Opposed Roll against the value of the original attack roll. This reflects the ability of highly skilled warriors to make more deadly strikes. Endurance rolls are not repeated unless the location is wounded again.

#### Minor Wound

Minor wounds are cuts, scratches, bruises, and sprains. They hurt, may bleed, but are not significant enough to slow down or hamper the victim.

#### Serious Wound

If a location is reduced to zero Hit Points or below, the victim receives a Serious Wound. The location is permanently scarred, and the victim cannot attack or start to cast spells (but can still Parry or Evade) for the next 1d3 Turns due to being stunned or distracted by the pain of the wound.

A character suffering a Serious Wound to a limb must immediately make an Opposed Roll of his Endurance versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in the limb being rendered useless, until the location is restored to positive Hit Points. If a leg, the victim drops prone. If an arm, whatever is being held drops, unless the object is strapped on (use common sense here).

A character suffering a Serious Wound to the abdomen, chest, or head must immediately make an Opposed Test of his Endurance versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in unconsciousness for a number of minutes equal to the amount of damage sustained in the attack causing the Serious Wound. First Aid or Healing skills can be used to help an unconscious victim regain further healing to the Seriously Wounded location.

At the Games Master's discretion, even if the character remains functional, all tasks requiring use of that Hit Location will suffer an ongoing penalty of one Difficulty Grade, until the injury is reduced to a Minor Wound.

#### Major Wound

If a location is reduced to a negative score equal to or greater than its starting Hit Points, the character receives a Major Wound. The character is immediately Incapacitated, unable to continue fighting. A limb is severed, transfixed, shattered, or ripped off by a Major Wound. The character drops prone, physically Incapacitated, and must immediately make an Opposed Test of Endurance versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in unconsciousness from the agony. If a severed, punctured, or ripped off location is not treated within a number of minutes equal to five times his Healing Rate, the character dies from blood loss and shock.

The victim of a Major Wound to the abdomen, chest, or head drops unconscious, totally Incapacitated, and must immediately make an Opposed Test of Endurance versus the successful attack roll of his enemy. Failure results in an instant and gratuitous death (decapitated, chopped in half, impaled through the heart, torn apart, and so forth). If they survive, and the location is not treated within a number of Combat Rounds equal to twice the character's Healing Rate, they still die from blood loss and shock.

Since most Major Wounds require some form of surgery or major magic to heal, the sufferer will be very unlikely to recover from a Major Wound in time to rejoin combat. Depending on the available treatment, the wounded location will be potentially maimed (see Healing from Injury page XX).

#### Blood Loss

Blood Loss due to external and internal wounds, usually sustained in combat, can wear a character down very quickly. Its effects are measured by the accumulation of Fatigue levels, much like Asphyxiation. Unrestrained Blood Loss typically results in death without some form of medical attention. Unlike Asphyxiation, the effects of serious Blood Loss on Fatigue are enduring. A character recovers Fatigue lost to bleeding at a rate of one level per day, starting the day after his exsanguinations cease.

#### Heroic Last Actions

In special cases where key characters receive a Major Wound, the Games Master might allow a heroic last Action - such as spitting out one last spell, attempting to cut down their slayer, crawling away to hide, or trying to tourniquet their own wound. They must have working limbs applicable to the Action and burn a Luck Point. They get a single opportunity to attempt their Action, and then immediately collapse into unconsciousness, and probable death.

## Healing from Injury

Natural healing from wounds and injuries is based on the character's Healing Rate. The Healing Rate dictates how many Hit Points are recovered in a location depending on the injury's nature:

- Minor Wounds: Days
- Serious Wounds: Weeks
- Major Wounds: Months

Thus, a character with a Healing Rate of 3 who suffers damage taking him to –3 in a Hit Location, a Serious Wound, will heal naturally at a rate of 3 Hit Points per week until his wound goes above zero, and then heal 3 Hit Points per day until fully recovered.

There are certain restrictions on natural healing:

- The healing character cannot engage in strenuous activity: otherwise, the Healing Rate is reduced by 1d3. Thus, a character recovering from even a Minor Wound could find his progress halted if they decide to engage in any physical tasks that might exacerbate the injuries.
- Natural healing will not begin to heal a Major Wound until the victim has been treated with a successful Healing roll (see page XX), or the casting of one of the Cure Wounds spells. Non-dismembering Major Wounds which are not treated within a number of days equal to one twentieth of the Healing skill become maimed, permanently reducing the Hit Points of the location.

### Magical Healing

Some magic can heal the wounds suffered by a victim. Yet there are specific restrictions as to what level of wound can be treated by each spell. For example, the Divine magic spell Cure Minor Wounds is most effective on Minor Wounds, as its name implies, whereas the spell Cure Serious Wounds is most effective on both Minor and Serious Wounds. Only the most powerful of magic can instantly reverse the traumatic injuries of a Major Wound.

No matter how petty the healing spell, its application is always enough to stabilize any type of wound, preventing bleeding and immediate death even if it does not actually cure the underlying injury. Note that this only applies to gross physical trauma, not to conditions brought about by suffocation, poison, and the like.

## Luck Points

Luck Points help differentiate heroes from the rank and file. They represent a character's ability to potentially turn failure into success and even cheat death.

Upon reaching Rank 2, and every Rank thereafter, all characters gain a bonus Luck Point. This somewhat simulates the gaining of extra Hit Points in Level-Based games, allowing characters of greater Rank to better handle themselves against things like dragons, demons, devils, and so on, without allowing them to take more punishment than an African bull elephant.

Luck Points can be used during play and, at the beginning of the next session, replenish to their usual value.

### Using Luck Points

Luck points can be used in a variety of ways. Only one Luck Point can be used in support of a particular Action. Luck Points cannot be spent on Experience or Training rolls. Each of the following options costs a single Luck Point.

### Cheat Fate

Characters can use a Luck Point to re-roll or swap (a 75 would become a 57 for example) any dice roll they make. This can be a skill roll, damage roll, or anything else that has some effect. Characters can even force an opponent to re-roll an attack or damage roll made against them.

### Desperate Effort

If a character has exhausted their Action Points during a fight and needs to find that last burst of desperate energy to perhaps avoid a messy demise, they may spend a Luck Point to gain an additional Action Point.

### Mitigate Damage

A character who suffers a Major Wound may spend a Luck Point to downgrade the injury to a Serious Wound. This reduces the damage taken to one Hit Point less than what would be required to inflict a Major Wound.

## Traps

Traps are ubiquitous devices used by every culture, from the digging of pitfalls to capture animals, to death-traps guarding tombs for all eternity. These devices are built for a range of purposes, each specifically tailored to raising an alarm, capturing interlopers, or maiming and killing thieves outright.

Constructing traps requires that the builder knows either the Mechanisms or Engineering skill. Small traps such as bear traps or trapped locks require Mechanisms, whereas large-scale constructions like spiked pits or rolling boulders need Engineering.

Beyond hiring a competent craftsman, traps often have very expensive components or manual labor costs. As a general guideline, alarms cost the skill of the creator in copper pieces, ensnaring traps the same in silver, and death-traps require payment in gold.

All traps have a Difficulty rating which represents how difficult it is to perceive, disarm, or avoid. This value is treated as its skill when resisted in an Opposed Roll.

Despite the many entertaining tales told by storytellers, traps – especially those intended to kill – rarely have a method of cleverly avoiding or reversing their effects once set in motion. Without magic or good fortune, those caught in a death trap usually succumb to its highly efficient purpose. In short, they are not intended to be survivable. Unless the trap has some cunning design or is some sort of enduring magical enchantment, once it has been sprung it must be manually reset.

### Trap Traits

Traps are described using the following traits.

### Purpose

The purpose of the trap. There are four major types:

- **Alarm** – Trap sends a silent or audible signal that it has been triggered.
- **Ensnaring** – Trap is designed to capture anyone who triggers or enters it.
- **Maiming** – Trap is intended to critically injure whoever triggers it.
- **Death** – Trap is intended to kill those who activate its lethal devices.

### Trigger

The way the trap is set off.

### Difficulty

The challenge rating of the trap, which is equal to the value of the Mechanisms or Engineering skill which created it. For instance, a scything blade trap built into the base of a treasure chest by a craftsman with Mechanisms 70% grants the trap a Difficulty of 70%. The trap would thereafter use this value in Opposed Rolls to see if the blade can be spotted, evaded, or disarmed.

### Resistance

How the trap is resisted – typically using Brawn, Evade, or Parrying with a Combat Skill that incorporates a shield. Resistance is rolled when the trap is triggered.

### Effect

What happens when the trap is sprung, and the victim(s) fail to resist? Usually this results in the alerting of antagonists if an alarm, or the capture of victims if designed to ensnare. Maiming and death-traps obviously injure the victim, although some death-traps utilize other means than direct damage to inflict harm, such as drowning or poison. To restrict overly deadly traps, the damage inflicted by most mechanical devices is limited by the skill of its creator. However, others such as traps that subject the victim to poison do not consider the crafter's actual skill. This is typically balanced by the expense of the poison used. The other exception to this is the Pit Trap, where the damage is simply based on the depth of the pit. In these cases, the skill of the crafter is used to determine the chance to spot, evade, and disarm the trap; damage is determined according to poison type, or distance fallen, as appropriate. Force is noted for those traps which fire projectiles that can be parried.

##### Death Trap Damage Limits

| Maker's Skill | Damage | Size/Force |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10% | 1d2 | Small |
| 11-20% | 1d4 | Small |
| 21-30% | 1d6 | Medium |
| 31-40% | 1d8 | Medium |
| 41-50% | 1d10 | Large |
| 51-60% | 2d6 | Large |
| 61-70% | 1d8+1d6 | Huge |
| 71-80% | 2d8 | Huge |
| 81-90% | 1d10+1d8 | Enormous |
| 91-100% | 2d10 | Enormous |

Damage may affect multiple random Hit Locations, with each additional location reducing the damage by one grade on the Death Trap Damage Limits table. For example, a trap designer with 50% skill could design a trap to do 1d10 damage to a single location, 1d8 damage to 1d2 Hit Locations, 1d6 damage to 1d3 locations, and so forth. The number of potential locations is set when the trap is designed and cannot be changed. Because the number of additional Hit Locations is random, there is the potential for less damage being done overall.

### Sample Traps

#### Pitfall

A pitfall is an archetypal trap used by every culture. It can take the form of a simple dug pit, covered by branches and leaves, or reach the sophistication of stone-walled sumps beneath hinged false floors, which are counterbalanced to swing back up into place after a victim drops in.

Pitfalls need not be particularly deep. If designed for capture, a simple amphora or lobster pot shape will prevent escape by climbing,

as will walls which are chiseled smooth or made from crumbling material that gives way under a character's weight. Pits which are instead intended to kill usually line the floor with dozens of stakes, closely packed so that a falling character will inevitably become impaled. Other options could include filling the bottom with a weak acid, water deep enough to drown in, or starving rats.

**Purpose:** Ensnaring or Death

**Trigger:** Walking across the false surface covering the pit

Difficulty: 60%

**Resistance:** Either Evade to jump clear or a Hard Athletics roll to catch the edge as they drop.

**Effect:** The drop into the pit inflicts 2d6 damage to a random Hit Location, armor does not protect. Secondary effects are left. to the Games Master's imagination.

#### Poison Needle Trap

This is another common trap found everywhere from a king's chamber to a forgotten tomb. This trap is typically placed upon a chest but can be found protecting door locks as well. Unless opened with the proper key, the trap will expel a small poison needle into the hand of any attempting to pick the lock.

**Purpose:** Ensnaring or Death

**Trigger:** Attempting to pick the lock of the trapped object.

Difficulty: 60%

Resistance: Endurance

**Effect:** When triggered, a small poison needle springs out and sticks into the hand of anyone attempting to pick the lock. Any poison may be used to coat the needle. If the poison is deadly, use the effects detailed for the Poison Gas Trap above, however applied only to the unfortunate lock picker.

# Chapter 8: Combat

Combat is an important feature of roleplaying games. Violent confrontation has ever been a way of settling problems, from vengeance-driven fights between nemeses, to the clash of armies in times of war. Nevertheless, combat need not be a savage battle to the death. Some combat encounters can be swashbuckling duels which end without injury, or perhaps light-hearted bar room brawls. _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ uses several terms to explain the core elements of combat. These are explained in the following sections, but in overview, these are:

### Combat Skill

The skill of wielding a group of weapons learned as part of a culture or profession.

### Combat Rounds

Bookkeeping time segments of five seconds each.

### Combat Actions

Possible acts a character can perform during a Round by the expenditure of an Action Point.

### Weapon Size

How difficult it is to Parry a particular weapon.

### Engagement

When combatants can hit or be hit by a direct opponent, depending on circumstances.

### Special Effects

Combat maneuvers which can be performed if one combatant gains the upper hand.

## Combat Skill

Combat skill represents a 'package' of multiple weapons related by Class, which avoids the necessity of learning each individual weapon separately.

The most important aspect of Combat Skill is that the character learns how to use each weapon in the skill, both singly and in combination so that they might be interchanged, as necessary. Combat training does not focus merely on using a specific weapon or weapons under best conditions, but also covers what to do when placed at a severe disadvantage. Such cross-training is a primary part of preparing a combatant for the unpredictable events of the battlefield, where weapon breakage or becoming disarmed is always a potential possibility.

All character Classes offer training in their Combat Skill. This may be a few weapons as in the case of the mage or be all encompassing and include all weapons and shields, as in the fighter.

## Running Combat

To emphasize its visceral nature, combat is tracked on a blow-by-blow basis. To ease bookkeeping, fights are broken down into Combat Rounds of five seconds each. During this period combatants may make hand-to-hand attacks or defend against them, maneuver into and out of combat, fire or throw a Ranged Weapon, and so on. Similar to real life, most combat engagements – once joined – are concluded in a matter of seconds rather than minutes. In game terms this means several Combat Rounds (usually three or less), unless participants withdraw to perhaps reset Initiative, reassess their tactical situation, or simply to grab a momentary rest before re-engaging. Only fights between well matched foes or sequences of opponents tend to last longer.

Combat Rounds use several important terms:

- **Initiative:** The order of who acts when during a Turn of a Combat Round. The Games Master counts down through Initiative values from the highest to the lowest, so that each participant has a chance to take their Turn when their number is reached.
- **Turns:** During each 5 second Combat Round, each participant has an opportunity to take one or more Turns, dependent on the number of Action Points they possess, and how they use them. Upon their Turn, participants perform one Combat Action, which comprises of a declaration, possible movement, any necessary dice rolls (including Reactions), and the resolution of the Action. If any participant has Action Points remaining, the players may each take another Turn in Initiative order. Once no Action Points remain, or any remaining are being held back for Reactions, play proceeds to the next Combat Round.

Each term is described in more detail, below.

### Initiative

Initiative determines participants' order of actions in a Combat Round. It is rolled at the start of a fight and determines when each character acts. Unless something occurs to change the situation, such as certain Combat Actions or Special Effects, Initiative remains in play until it is forced to be re-rolled.

Initiative is calculated by each participant rolling 1d10 and adding their Initiative Modifier. Whoever gained the highest result acts first, followed by the second highest and so on. When two or more participants tie scores, the one with the higher DEX will act first. If this still results in a tie, have each roll a die with high roll going before the other.

### Actions in Combat

Once Initiative has been determined, the participants have the potential to perform several Combat Actions during each Combat Round. All beginning characters get 2 Action Points per Round, with more gained as they go up in Rank, but when they can act is limited to whether the Action is proactive or Reactive. Proactive Actions can only be attempted on the character's own Turn; that is to say, during his Initiative. Proactive Actions are those in which the character is the instigator, such as making an attack with a weapon.

Reactive Actions are those taken by a character to counter or resist an act made against them. Only one reaction attempt is permitted for each threat, an example would be trying to Parry an attack.

Unused Action Points do not carry over from one Round to the next.

### Combat Actions

Combat Actions are those acts which can be performed during battle. Drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or diving clear from an attack are all examples of Combat Actions. Most are concerned with elements of combat itself, but some relate to activities outside the realm of spells and weapons.

As previously mentioned, how often a character can act per Round is limited by their available Action Points. These are spent over the course of each Combat Round to perform various Combat Actions. Once a combatant's Action Points are expended, they may no longer act for the remainder of that Round and must wait until their points reset at the beginning of the next.

Unless otherwise specified any Combat Action (save for "Free" Actions) costs one Action Point. Thus, combatants need to carefully consider how and when they use their Action Points. They may act as aggressively or defensively as they wish, dynamically reacting to the evolving circumstance of the combat.

#### Proactive Actions

The following are activities a character can attempt on his Turn by spending an Action Point. Note that some Actions such as spell casting or reloading may take several Turns to complete; each Turn costing its own Action Point.

**Attack**

The character can attempt to strike with a hand-to-hand weapon or use a Ranged Weapon.

**Brace**

The character braces by taking a firm stance and leaning into the direction of a forthcoming attack. For the purposes of resisting Knockback or Leaping Attacks, the character's SIZ is treated as 50% bigger. Against the Bash Special Effect, SIZ is doubled.

**Cast Magic**

The character can attempt to cast a spell, invoke certain racial or class abilities, or produce some other magical effect. Complex magics may require several Actions to complete the casting. Once concluded, the magic can be released at any moment up until the caster's next Turn – at which point it can be held for later effect, but this requires the Hold Magic Action (see below) to maintain it in preparation for later release.

**Change Range**

The character can attempt to close in on or retreat from an opponent.

**Charge**

The Charge Action allows a character to move into engagement range at running or sprinting speed, using the momentum of the charge to make a more forceful melee attack. Charging is covered on page XX.

**Delay**

The character conserves one or more Actions in order to perform Reactive Actions later, such as Interrupt or Parry. The Action Point costs of delaying is covered by whatever acts are finally performed. If the delayed Actions are not taken before the character's Turn in the next Round, then the character is considered to have Passed and the Action Points are lost.

**Dither**

The default option unless another Action is chosen, the character simply wastes his turn doing nothing useful.

**Hold Magic**

Once casting is complete, the character may hold a spell in temporary check, awaiting the best moment to release it. The magic may be held back for as long as the character continues to take this Action on subsequent Turns, but this allows free use of the Counter Spell reaction by an enemy if pertinent to the spell. The actual skill roll to cast the held spell is not made until it is cast.

**Hustle**

Provided they are not Engaged with an opponent, the character can run up to 3x Base Movement Rate or Sprint up to 5x Movement Rate. However, one cannot perform or have performed any other proactive Actions during this turn, including other movement.

**Mount**

The character can mount or dismount a riding beast or vehicle. Particularly large mounts may require several Turns to complete.

**Move**

Provided one is not Engaged with an opponent; the character can move up to Base Movement Rate. If this brings them into contact with an enemy, they may make a melee attack without expending a further Action to do so, either way, the character is then considered Engaged. Unlike the Hustle Action, the Move Action may be taken multiple times during a Combat Round.

**Outmaneuver**

The character can engage multiple opponents in a group Opposed Roll of Evade skills. Those who Fail to beat his roll cannot attack him in that Combat Round. See the section on Outmaneuvering on page XX.

**Ready**

The character may retrieve, draw, sheath, withdraw, or reload a weapon or other object. Retrieving a nearby dropped object requires 2 Actions: one to move and reach down for the object and a second to return to a readied stance. Some missile weapons require several Actions to reload.

**Regain Footing**

If unengaged with an opponent, the character can automatically regain his footing from being tripped or knocked down. If Engaged, the character must win an Opposed Test of Brawn or Athletics with the opponent before standing.

**Struggle**

If the character is the victim of certain types of attack or Special Effects, they may attempt to extract themself from the situation. For example, breaking free from a Grapple.

**Take Cover**

Take Cover is a proactive Action that allows the character to duck behind available cover in their immediate vicinity, thereby gaining some degree of protection against ranged attacks and spells. Unlike Evade it does not leave the user prone but does rely on some form of cover being available; for example, ducking back around a corner in a corridor or crouching down behind a table in a tavern.

#### Reactive Actions

This list specifies Reactions that can be used at any time during the Combat Round as a response to an imminent threat. As in the previous list, a reaction costs an Action Point to perform.

**Counter Spell**

The character can attempt to dismiss or counter an incoming spell. This assumes the countering magic has a Casting Time of one Turn, otherwise it must be prepared in advance and temporarily withheld using the Hold Magic Action. Successfully intercepting magic in this manner is assumed to negate the entire spell, even those with multiple targets or areas of effect.

**Evade**

The character can use their Evade skill in an attempt to dive clear of threats such as incoming missiles or a charging attack. This leaves the character prone unless mitigated by an Ability or special circumstance. Thus, the character's next turn is usually spent taking the Regain Footing Action to stand again. When Evading breath weapons or other Area of Effect attacks, if within 10 feet of the edge of the effect, a successful Evade will allow you to dive to safety and take no damage instead of half. This will still leave you prone, regardless of any special consequence that can negate that penalty. See Evading on page XX.

**Interrupt**

Delaying characters only. This Reactive Action halts an opponent's Turn at any point to take a delayed Turn Action. Assuming no change in the tactical situation, the opponent continues the Turn after the character's is completed. If unable to still achieve the original declaration, the opponent's Action Point is wasted. An interrupt can also be used to perform an attack-of-opportunity against anyone passing close by the delaying character and within weapon's reach.

**Parry**

The character can attempt to defend against an incoming attack using a combination of Parrying, leaning, ducking, and sidestepping footwork to minimize the blow.

#### Free Actions

Free Actions (listed below) can be performed at any time during the Combat Round and cost no Action Points to perform.

**Assess Situation**

If unengaged, a character can make a Perception roll at no Action Point cost. A Success reveals any relevant changes in the tactical situation (such as spotting a foe beginning a charge). Assessing while Running results in a Hard Perception roll, Sprinting is Formidable.

**Drop Item**

Dropping an item is a Free Action.

**Signal**

If unengaged, gesturing or signaling to one or more participants (if they can perceive the sign) is a Free Action.

**Speak**

A character can speak at any time during combat, but what is said should be limited to short phrases which can be uttered in five seconds or less; for example, 'Look out behind you!' or 'Damn you to hell!'

**Use Luck Point**

Using a Luck Point – to re-roll a particular result for example – is a Free Action.

**Ward Location**

The character guards a particular Hit Location from being hit by dedicating one of his weapons to passively block the area. Any blow which lands on that location has its damage automatically downgraded as per normal for a Parrying weapon of its Size. The cover continues until the dedicated weapon is used to attack or actively Parry. Establishing or changing the Hit Location covered must be performed prior to an opponent rolling to attack the character. Due to their design, shields can cover multiple areas.

For further explanation see Passive Blocking, page XX.

## Movement

The following rules govern engagement in combat:

- Movement is performed by either the Move, Hustle, or Charge Action.
- The Move Action allows the character to move a distance equal to their Base Movement Rate.
- The Hustle Action allows a character to run a distance equal to 3x Movement Rate, or Sprint at 5x Movement Rate.
- Movement can only be performed by unengaged characters (save for special cases such as Outmaneuvering).
- Except in certain cases (such as charging), all significant movement ceases once a character enters the engagement range of the intended opponent.
- Except in certain cases (such as Charging through Contact), moving into the opponent's engagement zone places each in engagement with the other.
- Once Engaged, characters cannot move away from an opponent unless first Withdrawing from close combat.
- Attempting to move past an unengaged foe who is using the Delay Combat Action, permits (as a specific exception) that opponent to strike at moving characters as they pass by or block a character's progress, prompting close combat on the following Turn or Round.

### Situational Movement Rates

These movement rates are situational and are not always an option. Many are detailed elsewhere but are included here for convenience. Most of these situational rates may be used in addition to a normal Movement Rate under set restrictions. Such information is detailed in the specific descriptions below.

#### Climb

A character that moves adjacent to or starts the Turn next to a climbable surface or object may climb at a rate equal to the Base Movement Rate. The character cannot have moved faster than a Walk and must have movement remaining, with the distance climbed being reduced by any movement already used. Worn armor hinders climbers, with each location covered by light armor counting as 1 additional 'Thing' carried, and each location covered by heavy armor counting as 2 additional 'Things' carried.

#### Crawl

A character that begins the Turn prone may crawl at a maximum rate of 5 feet per Turn in place of a normal Move. Creatures that naturally crawl as their normal mode of movement instead use the rules for Walk, Run, and Sprint set forth above.

#### Jump

A character that moves adjacent to or starts the Turn next to a jumpable obstacle may attempt to leap over it. The character may be moving at any rate up to the point of the leap. A successful Athletics roll allows one to jump up to twice one's own height horizontally or up to half one's own height vertically (if the character has at least a 15-foot run-up available). If jumping from a standing position, then these distances are halved. Reduce the jump distance in feet by half the total 'Things' carried. Worn armor hinders jumpers, with each location covered by light armor counting as 1 'Thing' in the beforementioned calculation, and heavy armor counts as 2 'Things.'

See the Athletics skill description in Chapter XX for more information.

On a Critical Success, the character adds a further 5 feet to his total distance and remains upright on landing.

A Fumble indicates Valamir has landed awkwardly. He must immediately make an Endurance roll. If the Endurance roll is a Success, 1 point of damage is sustained to one leg. If the Endurance test Fails, then 1d4 points of damage is inflicted instead.

#### Swim

A character that moves adjacent to or starts the Turn next to a body of water may swim at a rate equal to the Base Movement Rate, minus any movement already used. See the Swim skill description in Chapter 5 for more information. Under normal conditions a character's maximum swimming speed per Round is equal to their Movement Rate, -1 for each 'Thing' carried more than the character's STR. Worn armor hinders swimmers, with each location covered by light armor counting as 1 additional 'Thing' carried, and each location covered by heavy armor counting as 2 additional 'Things' carried. If total ENC reduces swim distance to 0 or less, the character automatically begins drowning (see Asphyxiation on page XX).

### Miniatures and Movement

Miniatures combat assumes the use of battle mats with a 1-inch square grid.

#### Scale

These rules work best where 1 inch is equal to either 5 feet or 10 feet.

#### Facing

A character's facing is one of the most important considerations on the battlefield. Leaving one side or your back open to attack is the fastest way to meet an untimely death. What follows are two facing diagrams. At the end of movement, a figure must be facing one of the sides of the square occupied, or optionally, into a diagonal, as seen below.

![](RackMultipart20240127-1-nuhbxe_html_ef37892583b066e4.jpg)

**Attacking** may be performed into any of the character's front or side squares.

**Evading** is always at Standard Difficulty against any attack except those from a back square, which is Formidable and requires a successful Perception roll to even know the attack is coming.

#### Effects of Terrain on Movement

Battlefields will usually have terrain of some type that hinders movement, represented as either Obstacles or Difficult Terrain.

Obstacles can be anything from huge trees, walls, high fences, doors, pits, and so on. An Obstacle completely blocks movement, requiring opponents to circumvent it; however, some creatures, like ghosts or those that fly, are unaffected by Obstacles. If an object doesn't completely block a square, like a chair, small tree, or bush, it is treated as Difficult Terrain.

Difficult terrain costs twice the normal movement to enter. Thus, moving into an area of Difficult Terrain in a 5-foot square would count as 10 feet of movement. A slow creature hindered by Difficult Terrain can always move a minimum of 5 feet. Some examples of Difficult Terrain would be shallow pools of water, rubble, low fences, bushes, tall grass/weeds, and dead bodies. Some creatures, like ghosts or those that fly are unaffected by Difficult Terrain. Passing through Difficult Terrain at any rate faster than the Base Movement Rate requires a Formidable Athletics or a Standard Acrobatics roll to avoid stumbling and falling.

## How Combat Works

Fighting in _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ is resolved with each attack or Parry representing a single stab, swing, spell cast, or shot of a weapon. Any offensive Action permits the chance to be resisted by a reaction. Thus, even if a character manages to strike an opponent, the foe is permitted their own roll to see if they can Parry the blow before it lands. The same philosophy is used whether the attacks are missile weapons against targets diving for cover or trying to break free from the iron grasp of a giant octopus.

### Attacks and Parries

Close combat is handled in the following step-by-step manner:

1. On his turn the attacker spends an Action Point, rolls against his Combat Skill, and notes the result.

2. If desired, the defender spends an Action Point, rolls against his Combat Skill, and notes the result.

3. The success level of the results are compared as per a Differential Roll (page XX).

4. Any difference grants the successful combatant with the superior roll one or more Special Effects.

5. If the attacker achieved a Success or Critical, they may roll weapon damage and apply their Damage Modifier (if any). If applicable, a Hit Location is determined for the blow.

6. If the defender achieved a Success or Critical, reduce any damage inflicted according to the comparative sizes of the weapons involved.

7. Reduce any remaining damage by the Armor Points of natural or worn protection.

Note that any Special Effects generated by the exchange are independent of whether damage is inflicted. It is quite possible for a defender to gain the higher success level, yet still suffer injury.

### Weapon Size

Every weapon in Classic Fantasy Imperative possesses several different attributes from the damage it deals to how many hands are required to wield it. Size is a combination of a weapon's mass, leverage, and stability, and is used to determine the weapon's ability to impose and Parry damage. Size categories are _Small, Medium, Large, Huge,_ and _Enormous_. The unarmed attacks of creatures are assigned similar categories according to their physical characteristics.

### Damage Reduction

If a defender succeeds in Parrying, then they can reduce an attacker's damage, if any, according to the comparative Size of the weapons used.

- Parrying an attack with a weapon or shield of _equal or greater_ Size deflects _all_ damage.
- Parrying with a weapon or shield of _one Size less_ only deflects _half_ damage.
- Parrying with a weapon or shield _two or more Sizes less_ fails to deflect _any_ damage.

For example, Parrying a great axe (Huge) with a kite shield (also Huge) would block all damage; Parrying it with a Longsword (Large) would halve the damage, and Parrying it with a shortsword (Medium) would stop no damage at all.

### Armor

Any damage which penetrates the defender's Parry is further reduced by the Armor Points of any natural protection (such as scales or a shell) or worn armor they possess. If the defender has both, then the two stack together to reduce damage.

Due to its mass and restriction to movement, the highest Armor Point value of armor _worn_ by a character acts as a penalty to their Initiative roll.

### Parrying a Missed Attack

If the attacker misses his initial attack roll, the defender has the option to spend an Action Point to Parry. Although it may seem disingenuous to Parry an attack which will miss anyway, a skilled defender can use this to his advantage to gain one or more Special Effects, potentially weakening or incapacitating a foe and preserving their next turn for some other Action.

### Unable or Unwilling to Parry

In a situation where a defender is unable to Parry due to having no Action Points remaining, or, confident in his ability to weather the blow, elects not to Parry, they are treated as having automatically rolled a Failure. This has the consequence of granting a successful attacker one or more Special Effects.

### Unsuccessful Rolls and Fumbles

If both combatants Fail their rolls, or the defender decides not to take advantage of a missed attack, then the attack - Parry sequence ends, and combat continues on to the participant with the next highest Initiative.

## Special Effects

Fighting is far more than simply injuring or killing an opponent. Combative arts teach many methods of _defeating_ a foe, perhaps rendering them helpless or forcing them into situations where they must capitulate, without necessarily needing to cause them harm. Special Effects represent these techniques and control how they occur in play.

Whenever opponents engage in a Differential Roll of their respective fighting skills, any resulting difference in success levels indicates an opportunity for Special Effects to occur. This reflects one combatant maneuvering his opponent into a disadvantageous situation which can be exploited using a cunning trick or tactic.

The number of Special Effects received depends on the difference between the Levels of Success, as illustrated on the Differential Levels of Success table (see page XX).

If any Special Effects are won during an exchange, they must be selected before Damage and Hit Location, if any, are rolled. In cases where the recipient is badly wounded in addition to receiving a Special Effect, Endurance rolls are resolved after the application of the effect.

Special Effects cover a diverse range of situations and techniques. Some are designed specifically for attacks, while others are intended for defense, and a few are adaptable for either circumstance. Certain Special Effects can also be limited to specific weapon types or specific dice rolls, requiring a Critical or Fumble result on their skill check for instance.

When two or more Special Effects are gained, the combatant may freely mix and match which ones are selected, providing the prerequisite conditions for each one is met. Some effects can be stacked. For example, an attacker who rolls a Critical Success and wins two Special Effects could choose Maximize Damage twice rather than choosing two separate offensive maneuvers.

### Special Effect Descriptions

_ **Accidental Injury** _: The defender deflects or twists an opponent's attack in such a way that the attacker fumbles, injuring themself. The attacker must roll damage against himself in a random Hit Location using the weapon used to strike. If unarmed, the attacker tears or breaks something internal, the damage roll ignoring any armor.

_ **Arise:** _ Allows the defender to use a momentary opening to roll back up to their feet.

_ **Bash** _: The attacker deliberately bashes the opponent off balance. How far the defender totters back or sideward depends on the weapon being used. Shields knock an opponent back 5 feet per for every 3 points of damage rolled (prior to any subtractions due to armor, parries, and so forth), whereas bludgeoning weapons knock back 5 feet per for every 5 points. Bashing works only on creatures up to twice the attacker's SIZ. If the recipient is forced backward into an obstacle, then they must make a Hard Athletics or Acrobatics skill roll to avoid falling or tripping over.

_ **Bleed:** _ The attack cuts open a major blood vessel. If the blow overcomes Armor Points and injures the target, the defender must make an Opposed Roll of Endurance against the original attack roll. If the defender Fails, then they begin to bleed profusely. At the start of each Combat Round, the recipient loses one level of Fatigue, until they collapse and possibly die. Bleeding wounds can be staunched by passing a First Aid skill roll, but the recipient can no longer perform any strenuous or violent action without re-opening the wound. See Blood Loss, page XX.

_ **Blind Opponent:** _ On a Critical the defender briefly blinds his opponent by throwing sand, reflecting sunlight off his shield, or some other tactic that briefly interferes with the attacker's vision. The attacker must make an Opposed Roll of his Evade skill (or Weapon skill if using a shield) against the defender's original Parry roll. If the attacker Fails, they suffer a situational modifier of Hard or Formidable for the next 1d3 Turns, depending on the method of blinding.

_ **Bypass Armor:** _ On a Critical the attacker finds a gap in the defender's natural or worn armor. If the defender is wearing armor above natural protection, then the attacker must decide which of the two is bypassed. This effect can be stacked to bypass both. For the purpose of this effect, physical protection gained from magic is considered as being worn armor.

_ **Choose Location:** _ When using hand-to-hand melee weapons the attacker may freely select the location where the blow lands, as long as that location is normally within reach. If using Ranged Weapons Choose Location is a Critical Success only, unless the target is within Close Range and is either stationary or unaware of the attacker.

_ **Circumvent Parry:** _ On a Critical the attacker may completely bypass an otherwise successful Parry.

_ **Damage Weapon** _: Permits the character to damage his opponent's weapon as part of an attack or Parry. If attacking, the character aims specifically at the defender's Parrying weapon and applies his damage roll to it, rather than the wielder. The targeted weapon uses its own Armor Points for resisting the damage. If reduced to zero Hit Points the weapon breaks.

_ **Disarm Opponent:** _ The character knocks, yanks, or twists the opponent's weapon out of his hand. The opponent must make an Opposed Roll of his Combat Style against the character's original roll. If the recipient of the disarm loses, his weapon is flung a distance equal to the roll of the disarmer's Damage Modifier x3 feet. If there is no Damage Modifier, then the weapon drops at the disarmed person's feet. The comparative size of the weapons affects the roll. Each step that the disarming character's weapon is larger increases the difficulty of the opponent's roll by one grade. Conversely, each step the disarming character's weapon is smaller makes the difficulty one grade easier. Disarming works only on creatures of up to twice the attacker's STR.

_ **Enhance Parry:** _ On a Critical the defender manages to deflect the entire force of an attack, no matter the Size of his weapon.

_ **Entangle:** _ Allows a character wielding an entangling weapon, such as a whip or net, to immobilize the location struck. An entangled arm cannot use whatever it is holding; a snared leg prevents the target from moving; while an enmeshed head, chest, or abdomen makes all skill rolls one grade harder. On his following turn, the wielder may spend an Action Point to make an automatic Trip Opponent attempt. An entangled victim can attempt to free himself on his turn by either attempting an Opposed Roll using Brawn to yank free, or win a Special Effect and select Damage Weapon, Disarm Opponent, or Slip Free.

_ **Force Failure:** _ Used when an opponent Fumbles, the character can combine Force Failure with any other Special Effect which requires an Opposed Roll to work. Force Failure causes the opponent to Fail his resistance roll by default – thereby automatically be disarmed, tripped, and so forth.

_ **Grip:** _ Provided the opponent is within the attacker's Unarmed Combat reach, they may use an empty hand (or similar limb capable of gripping) to hold onto the opponent, preventing them from being able to disengage from combat. The opponent may attempt to break free on his turn, requiring an Opposed Roll of either Brawn or Unarmed against whichever of the two skills the gripper prefers.

_ **Impale:** _ Roll weapon damage twice, with the attacker choosing which of the two results to use for the attack. Assuming the weapon is a melee weapon, if armor is penetrated and causes a wound, the attacker has the option of leaving the weapon in the wound or yanking it free on their next turn. Leaving the weapon in the wound inflicts a Difficulty Grade on the victim's future skill attempts. The severity of the penalty depends on the size of both the creature and the weapon impaling it, as listed on the Impale Effects Table below. For simplicity's sake, further impalements with the same sized weapon inflict no additional penalties. To withdraw an impaled weapon during melee requires use of the Ready Weapon Combat Action. The wielder must pass an unopposed Brawn roll (or win an Opposed Brawn roll if the opponent resists). Success pulls the weapon free, causing further injury to the same location equal to half the normal damage roll for that weapon, but without any Damage Modifier. Failure implies that the weapon remains stuck in the wound with no further effect, although the wielder may try again on their next turn. Specifically barbed weapons (such as harpoons) inflict normal damage. Armor does not reduce withdrawal damage. While it remains impaled, the attacker cannot use his impaling weapon for Parrying.

##### Impale Effects Table

| Creature SIZ | Small Weapons | Medium Weapons | Large Weapons | Huge Weapons | Enormous Weapons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-10 | Formidable | Herculean | Incapacitated | Incapacitated | Incapacitated |
| 11-20 | Hard | Formidable | Herculean | Incapacitated | Incapacitated |
| 21-30 | No Effect | Hard | Formidable | Herculean | Incapacitated |
| 31-40 | No Effect | No Effect | Hard | Formidable | Herculean |
| 41-50 | No Effect | No Effect | No Effect | Hard | Formidable |
| Each +10 | Follow table progression |

_ **Sharpshooter:** _ Permits the shooter to move the Hit Location struck by his shot by one step, to an immediately adjoining body area. Physiology has an effect on what can be re-targeted and common sense should be applied. Thus, using this Special Effect on a humanoid would permit an attacker who rolled a leg shot, to move it up to the abdomen instead. Conversely shooting a griffin in the chest would permit selection of the forelegs, wings, or head.

_ **Maximize Damage** _: On a Critical the character may substitute one of his weapon's damage dice for its full value. For example, a Hand Axe which normally does 1d6 damage would instead be treated as a 6, whereas a great club with 2d6 damage would instead inflict 1d6+6 damage. This Special Effect may be stacked. Although it can also be used for natural weapons, Maximize Damage does not affect the Damage Modifier of the attacker, which must be rolled normally.

_ **Prepare Counter:** _ The defender reads the patterns of his foe and prepares a counter against a specific Special Effect (which should be noted down in secret). If his opponent attempts to inflict the chosen Special Effect upon him during the fight, the defender instantly substitutes the attacker's effect with one of his own, which succeeds automatically.

_ **Rapid Reload:** _ When using a Ranged Weapon, the attacker reduces the reload time for the next shot by one. This effect can be stacked.

_ **Scar Foe:** _ The combatant inflicts his opponent with a scar that will be the talk of all for the rest of his or her life - such as an almost-severed-throat, or the letter 'Z' artfully inscribed across the chest.

_ **Select Target:** _ When an attacker Fumbles, the defender may maneuver or deflect the blow in such a way that it hits an adjacent bystander instead. This requires that the new target is within reach of the attacker's close combat weapon, or in the case of a ranged attack, is standing along the line of fire. The new victim is taken completely by surprise by the unexpected accident and has no chance to avoid the attack which automatically hits. In compensation, however, they suffer no Special Effect.

_ **Slip Free:** _ On a Critical the defender can automatically escape being Entangled, Gripped, or Pinned.

_ **Stun Location:** _ The attacker can use a bludgeoning weapon to temporarily stun the body part struck. If the blow overcomes Armor Points and injures the target, the defender must make an Opposed Roll of Endurance vs. the original attack roll. If the defender Fails, then the Hit Location is Incapacitated for a number of Turns equal to the damage inflicted. A blow to the torso causes the defender to stagger winded, only able to defend. A head shot renders the foe briefly insensible and unable to act.

_ **Sunder** _: The attacker may use a suitable weapon, such as an axe, to damage the armor or natural protection of an opponent. Any weapon damage, after reductions for Parrying or magic, is applied against the Armor Point value of the protection. Surplus damage over its Armor Points is then used to reduce the AP value of that armor(ed) location – ripping straps, bursting rings, creasing plates, or tearing away the hide, scales, or chitin of monsters. If any damage remains after the protection has been reduced to zero AP, it carries over onto the Hit Points of the location struck.

_ **Trip Opponent** _: The character attempts to overbalance or throw his opponent to the ground. The opponent must make an Opposed Roll of his Brawn, Evade, or Acrobatics against the character's original roll. If the target Fails, they fall prone. Quadruped opponents (or creatures with even more legs) may substitute their Athletics skill for Evade and treat the roll as one Difficulty Grade easier.

_ **Withdraw:** _ The defender may automatically withdraw out of reach, breaking off engagement with that particular opponent.

## Close Combat

Close combat is hand-to-hand fighting in its classic sense when combatants strike each other with wielded or natural weapons. The following guidelines offer ways to make close combat more interesting and help to further explain some concepts hinted at earlier in this chapter.

### Situational Modifiers

Situational modifiers may be applied when fighting in particular conditions, or as the result of a Special Effect. For example, fighting in the dark might incur a Difficulty Grade of Herculean. Unless stated otherwise, modifiers are decided by the Games Master. Where two or more situations are pertinent to the character, use the most severe.

Some modifiers are circumstance dependent, but rather than applying a Difficulty Grade the Combat Skill is limited by a relevant skill. For example, fighting from the back of a horse would cap the combatant's Combat Skill by their Ride skill, while fighting in water might cap it to the value of the character's Swim.

##### Close Combat Situational Modifiers

| Situation | Difficulty Grade |
| --- | --- |
| Attacking a helpless target | Automatic |
| Attacking in a confined situation | Hard |
| Defending while on lower ground or against mounted foe | Hard |
| Fighting while on unstable ground | Hard |
| Fighting while crouching or from one knee | Hard |
| Fighting in poor visibility (thick fog, snowstorm) | Hard |
| Defending against an attack from behind | Formidable |
| Fighting while prone | Formidable |
| Fighting in partial darkness (dim illumination) | Formidable |
| Fighting in pitch black conditions (no illumination at all) | Herculean |
| Blinded or loss of primary perceptive sense | Herculean |

### Engagement

A character is considered Engaged if within melee weapon range of an opponent. This does not necessarily require that both combatants can reach each other; only that one of them can be potentially struck by the other. Once a character has Engaged with an opponent, they can no longer freely depart that fight (charging past is a special exception). It requires some form of deliberate act to break contact with the foe, normally performed via a Combat Action such as Outmaneuver, or use of the Withdraw Special Effect.

### Charging

The Charge Action is the act of moving quickly to increase the force and impact of an attack. A charge requires the attacker to choose a Charge Action, moving at either a Running or Sprint gait. If this brings them into contact with their opponent, they must stop there and conduct the Attack Action, as modified for the charge. There is no minimum distance that must be covered before a charge can take place, as the distance moved is less a factor than the momentum achieved. Hence running or sprinting.

While charging, the attack roll suffers a Difficulty Grade of Hard. In return the charge increases the Size of the attacking weapon by one step and a bipedal attacker's Damage Modifier by one step; or two steps if a quadruped (or more legs). Riding characters may substitute their Damage Modifier for that of their mount instead. The final position of the charging character depends on the result of the exchange and whether the attacker wishes to stop or continue sweeping past, immediately breaking engagement.

Rather than Parrying or Evading, the recipient of a charge can simultaneously counterattack the charging attacker instead. In this case the wielder of the longer weapon strikes first. If the weapon can be set to receive a charge (such as a spear), the recipient may use the Damage Modifier of the charger instead of his own.

### Cover

Opponents use Cover to obstruct attacks against them, by either physically blocking a blow due to the toughness of the interposing material, or by obscuring where precisely the foe is. The precise value of cover depends on the thickness of its protection and the extent of its coverage.

An attack against a target that lands on an obscured Hit Location will be blocked to the extent of the cover's inherent protection. Cover can be partially negated either by use of the Choose Location Special Effect to aim at visible parts of the target, or striking through the cover if the weapon is capable of penetrating it.

In situations where cover is total, but the attacker believes his attack will penetrate, they may strike blindly at the hidden target. In such cases, the attack roll is one grade harder, and Choose Location may not be taken if a Special Effect is won. This assumes the attacker knows fairly accurately the target's position behind the cover.

### Evading

Evading in combat is to throw oneself clear of an overwhelming attack. This requires an Opposed Test of the Evade skill of the defender versus the attacker's pertinent roll. This could be anything from the Drive skill of a ramming battle tank to the spell casting skill of a magician. If the attacker wins then they inflict damage as per normal. If the defender wins, damage is completely avoided.

If the winner of the Opposed Roll achieves one or more Levels of Success over his opponent, they may select suitable Special Effects as per normal combat. Whatever the result, the evasive gambit leaves the defender prone - usually requiring the character to regain his footing on his following turn - unless they can use the _Arise_ Special Effect.

### Knockback

An attack which imparts more damage than the SIZ of the recipient will, by default, result in the character being knocked back. The damage in this circumstance is before any reduction due to Parrying or armor. On receiving such a blow, the recipient must pass an Easy Acrobatics or Standard Athletics roll to avoid falling prone. They are also thrust 5 feet backward for each 8 points of damage (or fraction thereof) over their SIZ. Proactively using the Brace Combat Action can reduce or even negate the effects of knockback.

### Leaping Attacks

Leaping attacks can be launched from a variety of situations, most are triggered as part of an ambush or at the conclusion of a charge, but some creatures can leap atop an opponent without the need for a run-up or superior height.

A leaping attack is resolved with an Opposed Roll of the leaper's Athletics skill versus the defender's Brawn or Evade skill. Quadruped targets make the attack roll one Difficulty Grade harder. If the leaper wins then the defender is automatically knocked prone, with the attacker astride them. Failure means the defender has weathered or sidestepped the impact. If the winner of the Opposed Roll achieves one or more Levels of Success over his opponent, they may select suitable Special Effects as per normal combat.

No damage is inflicted as part of the leap; however, a subsequently prone victim cannot recover his footing until either his attacker leaves, or they eventually win a Special Effect permitting them to Arise. In addition, leaping attacks only work against opponents of up to twice the attacker's SIZ. A target can make themselves more difficult to knock down by proactive use of the Brace Combat Action, provided they are aware of the impending leap attack.

### Outmaneuvering

A character facing multiple opponents can use movement to limit the number which can attack him at any time, constantly shifting position, forcing foes to interfere with one another. Outmaneuvering requires that the character has room to move about and is not pinned in a confining area.

Outmaneuvering requires that the character engages his opponents in a group Opposed Roll of Evade skills. Every participant, both the maneuvering character and those foes who wish to corner him, must spend an Action Point. Then they each roll once and those who fail to beat the maneuvering character's roll cannot attack him for the remainder of that Combat Round, being blocked by their allies or terrain features.

If the maneuvering character beats all of his opponents, one has the choice of safely engaging a single foe for the rest of the Round or Withdrawing from the fight completely.

### Passive Blocking

Passive Blocking allows a character armed with a weapon to hold it in such a way that it covers a chosen location (or locations when using a shield), but at the cost of being unable to actively Parry with it (see Ward Location page XX). Any attack which hits the locations automatically receives the benefit of the weapon or shield, reducing damage as normal. The technique is commonly used when a warrior wishes to guard a weak spot or wounded location. Nothing prevents a dual weapon, or weapon and shield combatant from using his other weapon to actively Parry.

Since Passive Blocking works in the same way as cover, the Choose Location Special Effect cannot be used to bypass the block in close combat, though opponents can still use the effect to strike other unblocked areas. Crouching down behind a shield allows a character to double the number of locations covered while Passive Blocking.

### Surprise

Surprise occurs when an unexpected attack is launched against opponents unaware of the attacker's presence or intention. An ambush would be an example of the former, while treacherously turning on an unsuspecting ally during amiable conversation illustrates the latter.

The effects of surprise on a target are potent:

- The target suffers a -10 penalty to Initiative.
- Until their Initiative arrives, they are considered flat-footed and cannot defend themselves.
- The first attack on the target, if successful, gains a bonus Special Effect
- For the remainder of the Round, they may not perform any offensive Action.

### Sweep Attacks

Sweep attacks occur at the Games Master's decision, when weapons or creatures of unusual size attack a closely clumped group of opponents – the scything tail of a huge dragon or the unstoppable charge of a giant triceratops for example – striking several foes simultaneously.

A sweep attack is made by applying a single attack roll of the weapon or creature to all targets in its path. Each defender must resolve the effects of the attack separately and any Special Effects imposed on the attacker are treated as having occurred concurrently.

## Ranged Combat

Ranged combat incorporates all forms of weaponry which require to be shot, thrown, or slung to strike their target. Ranged attacks are resolved in an identical way to close combat. However, Ranged Weapons can normally only be parried with shields; those without must rely on natural cover or use Evade to dive out of the line of fire. Thus, against lightly armored foes, Ranged Weapons can be formidable deterrents.

Each Ranged Weapon has several specific attributes which determine its effectiveness. The ones which have a key bearing on combat are as follows:

### Force

The Ranged Weapon equivalent of Size. It is an abstract measure of the penetrative power of a weapon or its ammunition to determine whether the blow overcomes a (shield) Parry.

### Damage Modifier

This Attribute shows whether or not the Damage Modifier of the attacker can be used to boost the Ranged Weapon's damage roll. In general, only self-drawn bows and thrown weapons allow the user to apply their Damage Modifier.

### Range

Three numbers separated by slashes, representing the maximum Close, Effective, and Long ranges of the weapon or its ammunition. Close Range is the distance over which the Choose Location Special Effect may be used, provided the target is stationary or unaware of the impending attack. Effective Range has no significant modifiers. At Long Range, the weapon can still inflict harm, but the amount of damage is halved, and Force is reduced by one step.

### Load

The time in Turns taken to load or reload a weapon that fires ammunition. A character can reduce the time spent loading or readying by use of the Rapid Reload Special Effect.

### Impale Size

The Size of an impaled weapon is different from the Force it strikes with. Ranged impaling weapons have a special column denoting their actual size when considering the hindrances caused by the Impale Special Effect.

### Situational Modifiers

As with close combat, situational modifiers may be applied when using Ranged Weapons in particular conditions. A character's Combat Skill may be capped when using the weapon in difficult circumstances, such as throwing a spear while riding a horse.

##### Ranged Combat Situational Modifiers

| Situation | Difficulty Grade |
| --- | --- |
| Light Wind\* | Hard |
| Moderate Wind\* | Formidable |
| Strong Wind\* | Herculean |
| Gale, Storm, or Worse\* | Hopeless |
| Target is Running | Hard |
| Target is Sprinting | Formidable |
| Target obscured by mist or is in partial darkness | Hard |
| Target obscured by thick smoke or is in darkness | Formidable |
| Target completely obscured | Herculean |
| Target completely invisible | Impossible\*\* |
| Target prone | Formidable |
| Attacker prone\*\*\* | Herculean |
| Attacker is on unstable ground | Hard |

\* Assumes the thrown weapon or ammunition is vulnerable to crosswinds, and supersedes the normal penalty imposed by the winds on normal skills.

\*\* Unless targets general location is revealed or known, then treat as Herculean

\*\*\* Penalty can be negated if using a crossbow from a prepared position.

### Aiming

By spending additional time aiming a Ranged Weapon, a character can potentially increase his chance of hitting. Aiming requires an entire Combat Round steadying the weapon and waiting for the best opportunity to release, for example withholding a bowshot for a momentary lull in the wind or until a target moves between two obstructions. By aiming, the character may reduce the difficulty of a Range or Situational Modifier by one grade. Additional Rounds spend aiming grant no further advantage.

### Firing into a Crowd

Firing into the swirling ebb and flow of a melee can be a risky business, thus there is always a risk of accidentally striking someone other than the original target being aimed at. When firing at a specific target at the edge of a crowd or melee, the attack suffers a Difficulty Grade of Hard. If trying to fire through it should be raised to Formidable. Aiming is still permitted to help mitigate the danger.

A sharpshooter who passes his attack roll despite the difficulty penalty has aimed true and will hit his intended target. If, however, the sharpshooter Fails the roll, but would have succeeded if not for the 'firing into a crowd' penalty, then an adjacent victim is struck instead (who is free to Evade or Parry as normal).

If more than one target is in the line of fire, the Games Master should determine the victim randomly. Any Special Effects won as part of the attack only apply to the original target, not any accidentally struck bystander.

# Chapter 9: Magic

_Classic Fantasy Imperative_ uses several default assumptions concerning the casting of magic. Since the same fundamental concepts are used by each discipline, these concepts have been collated here for easy reference and to avoid unnecessary duplication. The following rules are intended to be globally applied to all spellcasting.

## Magical Disciplines

_Classic Fantasy Imperative_ provides rules for three magical types, called disciplines herein. Each magical disciplines use the same basic system detailed in this chapter with regards to how magic works and how characters come by it. The following chapter details the specific spells usable by each discipline, Arcane and Divine, respectively.

## Magical Energy

Although knowledge of magical powers may be prevalent in a setting, it does not automatically follow that the magical energy required to invoke them is as widespread, or even available. Having the skill to transform someone into a leopard is useless if you do not have the energy to cast the spell or request the miracle from the gods.

While every character has an Attribute known as Magic Points, derived from their Characteristic POW, this merely represents the capacity to hold or store magical energy, not necessarily the ability to generate their own.

### Running Out of Magic Points

When Magic Points reach zero, no more spells or magical abilities that rely on them can be used.

### Magic Points: Use & Recovery

In _Classic Fantasy Imperative_, characters generate their own magical energy, attracting and storing it from the world around them. This is the most common method of recovery and is simply a matter of resting and letting one's body absorb the natural magical emanations of the world or as part of a relationship with a god, until the points are restored. The magical character need do nothing else. This assumes complete rest, comfort, and freedom from threat or stress. Camping in an occupied dungeon or resting in the wilderness during the depths of winter would prevent or hinder recovery, whereas returning to somewhere safe and sheltered like an inn would permit it.

A full night's sleep replenishes all Magic Points, half in a place of danger or distraction. In addition, 1 Magic Point can be regained per 15 minutes of prayer or study of one's spell book during a Short Rest (see page XX). Finally, Magic Points may be regained by quaffing a Potion of Magica as seen in the Magic Item Table on page XX. Magic Points do not recover while active in any other way.

## Starting Spells

Each spell casting Class has its own formula for determining their starting spells. This can be found in their respective write-ups under Class Abilities.

## Memorizing Spells

Just because a spellcaster knows a spell, does not mean they are ready to cast it. All spellcasters must commit spells to memory to have access to them when needed. The number of spells of their current Rank that a caster may have in memory is noted in the Rank Tables for each Class and found in their respective write-ups.

Memorizing a spell requires the caster to have first slept for at least 8 hours to have a clear mind. This sleep does not have to be continuous but must total at least 8 hours. The memorization process requires 15 minutes of calm study and concentration or prayer and devotion, regardless of Rank, as well as a calm, quiet area to concentrate. Regardless of Class, a caster that has already committed the maximum number of spells to memory must first forget one to memorize another. This requires 15 minutes per spell as above.

Mages must have access to their spell book to memorize a spell. A spell may not be memorized from another's spell book unless the desired spell is first deciphered by casting Read Magic. See Spell Books below.

When memorizing a Divine spell, the caster is assumed to be praying for their deity to grant them the ability to cast it. These spells may be drawn from any spells of the caster's Rank or below and placed into memory where they may be later cast. For example, a Rank 3 cleric may memorize any spell of Rank 3 or below.

## Learning New Spells

Each spell casting Class has its own system for learning new spells, detailed below.

### Learning New Arcane Spells

Learning Arcane spells requires extensive study and research, taking a significant period. However, the process may be considerably faster if the mage has access to another's spell book or a scroll. Each of the following procedures requires the mage to be of sufficient Rank to cast the spell in question.

### Rank Increase

Arcane casters automatically learn three new spells whenever they gain a new Rank. This assumes the caster has been slowly researching the spells over time and they may be inscribed in their spell book following the normal procedure, however neither an Arcane Knowledge roll nor expenditure of Experience Rolls is required.

### Through Research

To learn a new spell through research requires the investment of Experience Rolls equal in number to the spell's Rank. In addition, this research requires 1 week of study per spell Rank. For example, a Rank 2 spell would require 2 Experience Rolls and 2 weeks of study before the mage would be able to scribe it into their spell book. A character can break down the total investment of time and Experience Rolls into installments over several sessions of play. The mage is assumed to have been slowly scribing the spell into his spell book over the course of this research period. See The Scribing Process below for more information.

### From Spell Books and Scrolls

Having access to a scroll or another's spell book allows the mage to copy the desired spell into a spell book of their own, or even add the complete spell book to their own collection. However, because of the endless variation in writing styles, notations, and ancient script, each spell requires a casting of Read Magic before the mage may commit the spell to memory or scribe it into their own spell book.

However, if the casting of Read Magic Fails, the character does not get a second chance to decipher this spell (from this source). They are only able to determine the spell's Rank and its name but fail to fully understand the secret formulas. An Arcane caster may automatically read the contents of their own spell book, and once a spell has been successfully deciphered, there is no need for the character to decipher it again.

Learning spells in this way does not require any Experience Rolls on the part of the character, as the actual research has already been done by the other party. It is possible to decipher a spell, only to then find out that it is of a Rank beyond the capability of the character at the current time.

### Spell Books

Arcane spellcasters use spell books, sometimes called grimoires, to contain all their spell knowledge. These tomes are treasured by their owners, as a mage deprived of their spell book is limited to whatever spells they currently have in memory. While a beginning mage may require but a single book, eventually they will need to expand their library, both to encompass their growing store of magic and to back up years of hard work and research. At these times, a mage may consider a traveling spell book containing some of their most used and common spells, while leaving much of their knowledge backed up safely at home.

When written into a spell book, Arcane spells use a system of ancient script, detailed notations, and magical formulas. All Arcane spellcasters use the same system regardless of native language, culture, or species. However, each Arcane caster also inputs their own personal variations and nuances that make the writings incomprehensible to other spellcasters without the casting of Read Magic.

An Arcane caster may automatically read the contents of his own spell book and once a spell has been successfully deciphered with Read Magic, there is no need for the character to decipher it again.

### Learning New Divine Spells

Divine casters may memorize any spell they desire if they are of sufficient Rank. Therefore, a Divine caster learns all spells of a new Rank when they attain that Rank.

## Spell Casting Requirements

All spellcasters are assumed to use ritual words and gestures to aid in the focusing of Concentration required for their proper incantation.

The caster must have previously memorized the spell to be cast and must have the requisite number of Magic Points remaining. Attempting to cast a spell with insufficient Magic Points means that the spell simply does not work.

By default, the following requirements are necessary for the casting of spells:

- The ability to gesture or symbolize with at least 1 free hand.
- The ability to make appropriate vocal sounds to invoke the spell.
- The ability to accurately perceive or sense a potential target if the spell has to be targeted.
- The possession of generic material spell components

Being denied even one of the above requirements renders a spellcaster unable to cast any spell unless otherwise noted.

On the last turn of casting, the caster must pass an Arcane Casting or Divine Channeling skill check. Failing to cast the spell correctly usually results in nothing negative, save that the magic does not work, or at worst forgetting the memorized spell as detailed below.

Casting a spell does not expunge it from the character's memory. The spell remains and may be continuously cast if sufficient Magic Points remain to do so. Typically, even being rendered unconscious will not cause the loss of a memorized spell. However, a character that has been killed and somehow returned to life can be expected to have forgotten their prepared spells, with the exception of necessitation through some powerful life-giving magic.

### Spell Components

In addition to both somatic and verbal components, the caster must be in possession of material components that vary from spell to spell and are consumed in the casting. Where no actual components are detailed in the spell description, assume the cost is negligible and that the caster has enough on their person to cover an average adventure, or about a month or so of adventuring. If a specific component is noted, however, the caster will need to purchase and keep track of the required components. A caster that is somehow separated from their material components will be unable to cast any spells until the situation can be rectified.

### Restricted Actions During Casting

While performing magic, no matter what discipline, characters are only able to:

- Move at a maximum of walking pace.
- Perform Free or Reactive Actions.

Therefore, characters cannot attack any foes while preparing a spell, or make any attempt to run or indeed perform any other skill. This reflects the deliberation needed to focus on the spell and channel the energy for it to have its desired effect.

At the Games Master's discretion, some Reactive Actions such as Parrying, or Evading may make completing a spell more difficult due to disruptions incurred to the normally required somatic gestures or mental focus.

### Casting Spells While Engaged

Spells with a Range of no more than 5 feet, including Touch spells, may be cast while Engaged with an opponent. Spells with a Range of greater than 5 feet may not be cast while Engaged.

### Casting Touch Spells

Spells that require the caster to touch their opponent do not require an additional Unarmed skill roll to do so, as reaching out to make physical contact is assumed part of the spell's somatic component and is therefore covered by their spell casting roll.

### Interrupting Casting

All magic used in combat situations has casting times measured in periods of time from Instant to 1 or more Actions. This means a spellcaster performing more complex invocations can be slowed down in their casting by reacting to threats which use up their available Action Points. However, unless the caster suffers some dramatic shock, all this does is delay the final completion of the magic.

To totally disrupt casting normally requires that the caster be injured or mentally subdued. The chance of this depends on the precise circumstances:

- Successful implementation of the Spoil Spell Special Effect will automatically cause the casting roll to Fail.
- Minor Wounds force the caster to make a Willpower check, Failure makes the casting 1 Difficulty Grade harder.
- Serious Wounds force the caster to make a Willpower check, passing makes the casting 1 grade harder, while failing makes it 2 grades harder.
- Major Wounds automatically cause the casting roll to Fail.
- Succumbing to mental domination automatically causes the casting roll to Fail.

## Casting in Armor

**Clerics:** Clerics suffer no penalty while armored or using a shield.

**Mages:** Because armor restricts movement, and the somatic component involved in the casting of spells requires precise gestures, mages cannot cast while wearing armor or using a shield.

## Casting Time

Spells generally require a set Casting Time regardless of Intensity. This is usually measured as Instant, # Actions, # Minutes, or #

Hours. Other casting times are possible depending on the specific spell.

How this interacts with each specific Casting Time is further detailed below:

- **Instant** : Spell may be either Proactive or Reactive and goes off as soon as cast. It may be cast as a Free Action.
- **1 Action** : Spell is Proactive only and goes off on the same Turn that it is cast.
- **2 or more Actions** : Spell is Proactive only and goes off on the last Turn required to cast it.
- **Minutes, Hours, and so on** : Spells with extensive casting times are typically used out of combat and therefore do not require detailed tracking.

Where a spell requires more than 1 Action to cast, the Action Points are spent each Turn, with the casting skill roll taking place on the final Turn of casting. Only once the spell's Casting Time has finished is the caster required to expend the Magic Point Casting Cost, shown below.

## Casting Cost

The cost of casting a spell, regardless of the actual discipline, depends on the spell's final Intensity, the caster's Rank, and the success level of the casting skill roll. Spells are cast at a base Intensity of 1 and may be increased to their Maximum Intensity to boost their effects by paying the extra Magic Points. The required cost may be expressed as _1_, meaning that the spell cost 1 Magic Point and typically has a set Intensity, or, _1, +1/additional Intensity_, meaning the spell cost a single Magic Point, and may be boosted at an additional cost of 1 Magic Point per Intensity beyond the first, or, _3/Intensity_, meaning that each level of Intensity costs 3 Magic Points, or any other similar combination.

Some powerful spells can alter reality in some lasting way. In addition to the noted Magic Point expenditure, these spells require a permanent expenditure of life force on the part of the caster. This life force is represented in the sacrifice of 1 or more Experience Rolls and will be expressed as (+1 EXP) or similar. These Experience Rolls must be already acquired and unspent. Spells that require an Experience Roll have their Magnitude doubled for the purposes of resisting spells such as Dispel Magic.

Once the final cost is known, the Spell Casting roll is made:

- **Critical:** The spell works and only half the Magic Point cost is expended. A spell possessing a cost of 1 may be cast for free. Any required EXP rolls are halved as well, with a minimum of one in either case.
- **Success:** The spell works, and the full Magic Point cost and any required EXP rolls are expended.
- **Failure:** The spell fails, but no Magic Points are expended, nor are any Experience Rolls. Optionally, however, the caster may force the spell. A forced spell is treated as a Success above with regards to Magic Point expenditure and degree of success. Forcing a spell has the unfortunate side effect of expunging it from the caster's memory, meaning it must be memorized again before it may be recast.
- **Fumble:** The spell fails, and half the Magic Point cost is expended; however, all Experience Rolls are retained. In addition, the desired spell is expunged from the caster's memory. It may be re-memorized later.

Maximum EXP on Spells

As noted under Casting Cost above, more powerful spells require an expenditure of lifeforce, and thus spending one or more EXP rolls along with the requisite number of Magic Points. This can be unspent EXP the character has saved for spell casting or simply has yet to apply to skills and abilities. The character's Rank sets a limit on the maximum number of EXP rolls that they may expend on spells in any one game session. For example, a Rank 3 magic-user can spend up to 3 EXP rolls on spells during a particular session but once spent, other spells requiring EXP may not be cast until the next game session.

## Casting Cost Reduction and Caster Rank

As a spellcaster increases in Rank, they learn more efficient ways to channel their personal reserves of magical energy. For each Rank attained above 1, a spellcaster may cast spells of a lower Rank at a reduction of 2 Magic Points per Rank of difference. This does not reduce the Casting Cost per Intensity, just the final Casting Cost of the spell in question. Therefore, a spellcaster of Rank 3 that casts a Rank 2 spell may reduce the final Casting Cost by 2 Magic Points, while that same caster may cast a spell of Rank 1 at a 4-point reduction. This is summarized on the Magic Point Reduction Matrix below.

No spell may have its final cost reduced below 1 Magic Point.

##### Magic Point Reduction Matrix

|
 | Spell's Rank |
| --- | --- |
| Caster's Rank | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| 1 | 0 | - | - | - | - |
| 2 | -2 | 0 | - | - | - |
| 3 | -4 | -2 | 0 | - | - |
| 4 | -6 | -4 | -2 | 0 | - |
| 5 | -8 | -6 | -4 | -2 | 0 |

## Dismissing One's Own Magic

Characters can dismiss any magic they have personally cast as a Free Action. No roll is needed for dismissing a spell; simply the decision needed to cease its effects.

## Magnitude & Intensity

These two terms are methods of describing the potency of magic. Magnitude indicates how difficult it is to dispel or resist the magic, whereas Intensity reflects its level of effect. More detail concerning these terms is described for each discipline.

Although Maximum Intensity and Magnitude are based upon the value of a magical skill, they are not modified by any Difficulty Grades applied to the casting roll. For example, the Maximum Intensity of a spell is 1/10th the caster's Arcane Casting or Divine Channeling skill, no matter whether the casting roll is Easy, Hard, or even Herculean. The spell may be cast at any Intensity of between 1 and its Maximum Intensity. The spell's Magnitude is always based on the Maximum. Therefore, a caster with 60% skill may choose to cast a 3 Intensity Fire Ball; however, the spell will still possess a Magnitude of 6. A caster need not increase the Intensity to their Maximum values if they desire to limit the spell's effect or keep its Magic Point cost low. In addition, not all spells benefit from an increase in Intensity.

For example, with an Arcane Casting skill of 56%, Rengarth possesses a Maximum Intensity and Magnitude of 6, for any spell he chooses to cast. His spell's Intensity starts at 1 and may be increased to 6 by spending additional Magic Points. His spell's Magnitude is 6 regardless of final Intensity.

## Maintaining a Spell

Spells with Durations based on Intensity do not have to be initially cast beyond an Intensity of 1 unless the caster so desires. Instead, the caster may choose (at the beginning of each period covered by the Duration), whether to maintain the spell or let it end. To maintain the spell, the caster simply spends the required Magic Points, and the spell continues for another period based on the Duration.

The only stipulation is that the caster must concentrate throughout the Duration, even in the case of spells that do not normally require Concentration. Once Concentration is ceased, the spell will finish out its current Duration and then end, unless Concentration is normally required, in which the spell ends immediately. The most that a spell may be maintained is still limited to its Magnitude as determined by 1/10th casting skill.

For example, Detect Magic has a Duration noted as 2 Minutes/Intensity, this means that at 3 levels of Intensity, the spell will last 6 minutes. However, there is no reason why the caster could not cast the spell at Intensity 1 for 2 minutes and extend the Duration when the current Duration expires. In this case, the caster would have to maintain Concentration throughout the first 2 minutes and could spend another Magic Point to extend it another 2 minutes after the first Duration has expired. If after choosing to maintain Detect Magic for another 2 minutes, the caster chooses to cease Concentration, the spell will finish out its current Duration and then end.

## Resisting Magic

Most spells and magical effects that target an individual allow that individual a chance to resist; this is sometimes called rolling to save. Resisting targets may make an Opposed Endurance, Willpower, or even an Evade test in the case of a targeted missile spell. Note that Resist (Evade) requires the target to have a Combat Action available to throw themselves clear. Spells that may be resisted are always easier to resist at lower levels of Magnitude. To resist a spell, the victim compares the results of their Resistance roll with the caster's Arcane Casting or Channel skill roll. Where the original caster's skill is unknown, which may be the case of spells with Permanent durations, magical traps, and so on, make a casting skill roll at 55% for Rank 1 spells, +20% per additional Rank of the spell. Therefore, a Rank 3 spell would be resisted as if the caster had a skill of 95%.

## Dispelling Magic

All magic resists being dispelled using its Magnitude. Thus, at lower levels of skill, magic can be easy to dismiss. When Dispel Magic is cast against an ongoing magical effect or a magic item, there is no roll to resist. Instead, if the Intensity of Dispel Magic exceeds the Magnitude of the magic, it is dispelled, temporarily in the case of a magic item, or a spell with a Duration expressed as Permanent. See the write-up for Dispel Magic in Chapter 10: Spells. In addition to Dispel Magic, some spells may be used to dispel other spells if they are the same or opposed. These spells will be noted as such in their write-ups. The spell Light, for example, may be used to dispel Darkness.

In these cases, every 1 level of Intensity counts as 3 Intensity with regards to countering the spell.

For example, if confronted with Darkness of Magnitude 6, the caster would need Dispel Magic of Intensity 7, or Light of only Intensity 3 to counter it.

It should be stressed, that under most circumstances, the Magnitude of an existing spell is unknown and dispelling it is a matter of trial and error.

## Enduring Magic Costs

As a rule, the Magic Points (or pool) of a spellcaster are temporarily reduced by the cost of all ongoing active magic. The caster is unable to start recovering Magic Points used to cast a spell (or similar ability) until that magic is dismissed or expires. Therefore, spells such as Charm Person, which can have a Duration measured in weeks, can severely hamper a magic-user that has decided to charm his own personal retinue. A spell with a Duration noted as Permanent does not affect the caster's Magic Point total.

## Spell Traits

Every Spell is defined by a series of traits explaining how it is used in the game, followed by a description of the spell's precise effects. In most cases the physical and temporal parameters of the spell can be hand waved unless the Games Master wishes to keep detailed track during tactical situations. A spell's traits are detailed using the following format:

Spell Name (Reversed Spell Name)

(School)

| **Rank** : Clr 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Light | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 1, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : 20' Radius | **Resist** : Willpower |

The traits are as follows:

(Reversed Spell Name): Some spells are Reversible; these spells will have their reversed version names in parentheses after the spell's primary name. A spellcaster must choose when memorizing a spell noted as Reversible, whether it will be the normal or reversed version. It is possible to have both the normal and reversed versions of the same spell memorized.

(School): Following the name of the spell, is the School it belongs to. Spells belong to one of eight specific Schools of Magic, and while they are noted for both Arcane and Divine spells, the information is of most use to casters of the Arcane persuasion. While most mages remain generalists, being able to learn any spell, some prefer to concentrate on one School at the expense of others.

For example, the School of Evocation specializes in manipulating unseen sources of power to create devastating damaging effects, granting access to spells such as Fireball, Lightning Bolt, and Magic Missile. On the other hand, the School of Enchantment teaches spells that affect the minds of others, allowing the caster to control or influence their normal behavior. This School includes spells such as Charm Person, Befuddle, and Command.

A magic-user's spell book might only contain spells of a single School, or it could contain several spells of each. The precise balance or lack thereof is dependent upon the original creator of the spell book.

Spells of the School of Enchantment have (Charm) noted as a reminder that these spells are typically subject to immunity by elves and half-elves. See the magic-user description in chapter 3 for the rules on specialist mages and more information on the various Schools of Magic.

**Rank:** Notes the spell's Rank as it pertains to the Classes that can cast it. A spell that is Rank 1 for one Class, may be Rank 2 or even higher for another. Classes are abbreviated as Clr (Cleric) or Mag (Magic-User). Mag 1 denotes a that it is a Rank 1 Magic-User spell for example.

**Sphere:** Arcane spells do not have this trait. Divine spells are classified according to Sphere, of which there are 16: All, Animal, Astral, Charm, Combat, Creation, Divination, Elemental, Guardian, Healing, Necromantic, Plant, Protection, Summoning, Sun, and Weather. Where more than one Sphere is noted, the character Class must have access to each. Some spells note a separate Sphere in parentheses; this details the spell's Sphere when reversed. Deities have several Spheres of Influence which is a determining part of their nature.

**Cost (X):** This is the cost in Magic Points to cast a spell. For example, a spell with a cost noted as 1, costs a single Magic Point to cast and cannot be increased in Intensity, while 3, +1/additional Intensity would cost 5 Magic Points to cast at 3 Intensity (3 for the first level, and 1 for each additional). Some spells which alter reality in a significant way have an additional cost in Experience Rolls, for example (+1 EXP).

**Area (X):** The spell affects all targets within a defined area. This could be either a set amount, such as 20,' or as a variable such as 10'/Intensity. For example, a spell with an Area trait expressed as 10' Radius/Intensity, cast at Intensity 4 would have a radius of 40.' An Area spell with a Range of 0 has the effects centered upon the caster or whatever they touch.

- **Caster:** The spell affects the caster only.
- **1 or more Targets:** The spell affects one or more targets, of which one may be the caster if desired.
- **Cone (X):** The spell affects all targets within a specified Cone-shaped area. Cones possess three equal dimensions, length, width, and height with the specific dimensions defined in the description.
- **Path:** The spell affects all targets within a specified predefined Path.
- **Radius (X):** Radius measures a circular area from its center to its edge. Therefore, an area with a 20' radius is 40' across.
- **Wedge (X):** The spell affects all targets within a specified Wedge-shaped area. Wedges possess two equal dimensions; length and width, lacking any vertical dimension, with the specific dimensions defined in the description.

**Casting Time (Instant, Turns, Actions, Minutes, or Hours):** The length of time required to cast a spell is defined as Instant, or 1 or more Actions, Rounds, Minutes, or Hours. This Casting Time is not typically modified by Intensity unless otherwise noted.

**Duration (X):** The spell's effects stay in place for an amount of time described as either a set length, such as 10 minutes, or as a variable such as 5 Minutes/Intensity. Spells noted as Instant take place immediately and then end, while spells detailed as Permanent have a lasting effect.

- **Concentration:** The spell's active effects only function so long as the character specifically concentrates on it. Concentration requires the caster to be free of all physical and mental distractions: any such disturbance has a chance to interrupt the Concentration, resulting in the spell's immediate dismissal. Distraction follows the rules outlined on page XX for Interrupting Casting.
- While concentrating, the caster is usually restricted to moving at a maximum of walking pace and performing Free or Reactive Actions (when necessary, use common sense). Any passive elements of the spell continue running without the need to concentrate unless the spell states otherwise; _for example, the Spiritual Hammer spell requires Concentration to move and attack with it, as soon as the cleric's Concentration lapses, the spell ends_. By default, a spellcaster may only concentrate on a single Concentration spell at any one time.
- **Trigger:** Trigger spells have their effects delayed by a period defined in the spell's description or sometimes at a time determined by the caster. If a spell not defined as permanent until triggered is not triggered within a four-hour period, it dissipates naturally.

**Range (X):** Ranged spells may be cast upon targets within a Range defined as either Touch, or a set amount such as 40'. For example, a spell with a ranged trait expressed as 20'/Intensity and cast at Intensity 3 would have a Range of 60'. A spell with a Range of 0 may be cast on the caster only.

With regards to Touch spells, the spellcaster may always be the beneficiary if desired. Otherwise, the caster must be in physical contact with the target for the spell to take effect. These spells are typically cast and then held until the caster can make a successful Unarmed skill roll to touch an opponent. However, if the caster is within reach of a suitable opponent on the same Turn that the casting is finished, they may touch the opponent without a separate Unarmed roll being required. This assumes the roll to hit is part of the spell's somatic component. The opponent may Parry or Evade normally, and if struck, is still allowed an Opposed Roll to resist as specified in the spell description, with a success on the part of the victim negating any adverse effects. A Touch spell merely needs to contact the target or its worn accoutrements to work.

**Resist (Disbelief/Evade/Endurance/Willpower):** Offensive spells do not necessarily take effect automatically. Resisting targets may make an Opposed Evade, Endurance, or Willpower test (as specified in the description) in order to avoid the effect of the spell entirely. Note that Resist (Evade) spells require the target to have a Combat Action available to throw themselves clear, and Disbelief must be stated by the player and is situation dependent. See Disbelieving Illusions and Phantasms later in this chapter for additional information.

### Limiting Some Spell Traits

Many spells will augment more than 1 trait per level of Intensity. For example, Part Water is noted as possessing the traits: Duration: 10 Minutes/Intensity and Range: 60 ft/Intensity. In these cases, under normal circumstances Duration and Range are equally affected based upon final Intensity. However, if the caster chooses, they may keep some of the traits at full Intensity and limit others. Therefore, if Part Water were to be cast at 4 Intensity, it would normally possess a Duration of 40 minutes with a Range of 240 feet. If desired, the caster could keep the 240-foot Range, but have the spell only last for 5 minutes.

There is no minimum amount imposed on a spell trait. The only exception would be a spell with a static trait unaffected by Intensity. In this instance the trait may not be altered. For example, a Fireball spell possesses a radius of 20 feet. One of the things that balances this powerful spell is that it cannot have its area modified, making it just as dangerous to allies and enemies if not used with caution.

## Illusions and Phantasms

Illusions and phantasms are two different types of magic that produce similar effects yet operate under a different set of parameters. Both attempt to trick the senses of those observing them into believing they are real, and the prospect of using them successfully in play comes from knowing what each is capable and incapable of doing. Constructs such as golems and programmed undead such as skeletons and zombies are immune to the effects of illusions and phantasms, lacking any form of cognitive reasoning beyond simple programming. Both phantasms and illusions, while similar, operate differently as detailed below:

### Illusion

An illusion is a manifestation that is created within an area. Once it comes into being, everyone that happens upon the area will see the illusion for as long as it remains. Depending on the specific spell, illusions may manipulate light, sound, shadow, color, and/or scent. Some of the higher Rank forms of illusionary magic may create manifestations of quasi-reality by drawing magical energy from other planes of existence. These illusions are real for all intents and purposes for as long as the witnesses believe in them. Simple illusions may be of anything the illusionist desires, their only real limitation is that they cannot make something look like nothing. Therefore, while a simple illusion could not turn something invisible, it could camouflage it with a thick area of fog, or simply change its appearance. The exception to this is the Invisibility spell, which is specialized Illusion magic with the sole purpose of turning a creature invisible at the expense of versatility.

Illusions possess an Area of Effect when cast. This does not imply that the illusion can only be seen within the designated area, only that the manifestation must fit within the Area of Effect. The manifestation can typically be seen at a distance appropriate to its nature.

For example, the illusion of a swampy bog may not be seen until the viewers are right upon it, while an illusion of a wizard's tower may be seen from a mile away. While the illusion is in effect, it may be viewed by all that experience it, not just those present when the spell was cast.

Unless specified otherwise, an illusion is dispelled by simply touching it, whether with a bare hand, melee weapon, or even striking it with a hurled object. However, if the original caster is present and maintaining Concentration, they may prevent the illusion from unraveling and have it react appropriately. This requires the expenditure of 1 Magic Point on the part of the caster. It is subject to disbelief as normal, as well as Dispel Magic, if it overcomes the spell's Magnitude, both of which will dispel the manifestation.

For example, instead of letting an illusion struck in combat be dispelled, the illusionist could spend a Magic Point and have the illusionary creature react to the hit in an appropriate manner.

### Phantasm

A Phantasm is a manifestation that is created within the mind of one or more living creatures; because of this they may never manifest as quasi-reality. Most phantasms attempt to instill intense emotion on the part of the victim, typically those of fear and terror. Because of their nature, phantasms function differently than other spells (illusions included), with regards to Duration and Area of Effect.

For example, a phantasm with a 60' radius and a Duration of 10 minutes that has been cast on a party of adventurers will cause the party to be affected by the manifestation throughout the spell's Duration. Even if they leave the Area of Effect, they will see the manifestation within the designated area upon looking back. However, if a second group enters the spells Area of Effect while the Duration is still active, they will see nothing out of the ordinary, as they were not the targets of the spell.

Unlike an illusion, phantasms cannot be touched, and therefore, cannot be dispelled in this manner. They are subject to disbelief as normal, but since they are rooted deep in the psyche of the victim, it is much harder to do so. Assume it is two grades more difficult. The casting of Dispel Magic will remove the phantasm from the mind of a victim if it overcomes the spell's Magnitude as normal. However, due to the nature of a phantasm, the caster must target a single character suffering its effects and cast it on them.

### Limitations

There is no limit placed upon what the caster may create if it fits within the spell's parameters; however, the players are more likely to attempt to Disbelieve if they feel an illusion is out-of-place or simply not realistic under the circumstances. Likewise, an NPC will have that same opportunity to Disbelieve something that seems unrealistic as determined by the Games Master. A more successful illusion is typically of something the caster knows well. While it would be possible to create an illusion of something that the caster has only seen in a painting or heard about, it cannot and will not look as realistic as something they have personal knowledge of. For this reason, the simpler illusion the more believable, as it tends to give off fewer clues to its true nature.

Neither illusions nor phantasms allow the caster to break physical laws. A character would not be able to physically mount an illusionary horse; even assuming the caster maintains the illusion and prevents it from unraveling when one attempts to do so. And an illusionary bridge will not allow a party of adventurers to cross a real chasm no matter how well those affected believe in its existence. Where possible, however, those subjected to the illusion will believe things are transpiring as expected. For example, the rider attempting to mount the illusionary horse will see himself sitting atop it, reigns in hand, as will all others under the spell's effects, and the party of adventurers crossing the illusionary bridge will see themselves doing so…, until they impact with the bottom of the chasm.

While being concentrated upon, illusions may be made to attack and/or cause injury as appropriate to their nature with the caster determining the actual results of hits, damage, and so forth. This requires the caster to continually concentrate throughout the spell's Duration. Of course, this damage is only in the minds of the victims and no actual damage is done; however, they will believe it for real if the illusion exists, or until they Disbelieve. The illusionist may choose to have armor and magic block this damage as appropriate and dictate the results of Specials as desired. Any damage sustained from an illusionary attack or threat is treated as "real" damage as far as wound levels are concerned; however, as soon as an illusion is revealed for what it truly is, any damage previously incurred by the victim vanishes. As noted above, the caster needs to keep these results realistic and in proportion to the threat in question.

For example, an illusion of a band of attacking kobolds that cause a party of low Rank adventurers some difficulty before being put down would be an expected and common encounter; however, if these same kobolds display skills of master level, never missing and apparently sidestepping every blow, the players should more than likely display suspicion and would be well within their rights to attempt to Disbelieve.

A character that is "killed" by an illusion collapses as if dead. The Games Master should make a Willpower roll for the victim, the effects of which are as follows:

- **Fumble:** The character dies from system shock due to illusionary trauma
- **Failure:** The character awakens unharmed after 1d6 minutes
- **Success:** The character awakens unharmed in 1d6 Rounds
- **Critical:** The character resists losing consciousness and may immediately attempt to Disbelieve

Illusions are automatically dispelled if touched unless the caster concentrates and maintains it. It is subject to disbelief as normal as well as Dispel Magic, which will dispel the manifestation. In the case of a larger manifestation, Dispel Magic will dispel a portion of the illusion's Area of Effect equal to its own.

### Attempting to Disbelieve

To attempt to Disbelieve a common illusion, the viewers must state their intent and succeed at an Opposed Roll of their Willpower versus the Arcane Casting or Divine Channeling roll of the original spellcaster, as appropriate. With regards to disbelieving phantasms, which are essentially mental attacks, a character is allowed a chance to Disbelieve as soon as they are subjected to the spell; however, the Games Master should secretly make this roll on their behalf to not hint at the phantasm's true nature. Because Phantasms affect the mind directly, they are typically 2 grades more difficult to Disbelieve. In either case, a Success indicates that the viewer sees the illusion or phantasm for what it is. A Failed roll has no effect on the state of the apparition and no further attempts may be made unless stated otherwise (see below). Only sapient creatures (those with an INT Characteristic) may attempt to Disbelieve. Phantasms and illusions may also be destroyed with the casting of Dispel Magic.

The more unbelievable the illusion, the easier it is to Disbelieve, and vice versa. After the first attempt to Disbelieve, further attempts are only possible if the manifestation suddenly does something that causes a victim to question its reality. This should be on a case-by-case basis and only allowed with the Games Master's permission.

In the likely situation where some viewers see the manifestation for what it is, and others believe what they see, the players should play out the encounter as their characters believe it. _For example, those that know the ogre before them is an illusion or phantasm will attempt to reveal the true nature of the manifestation to their unbelieving allies. However, those under the spell's influence will be convinced that their friends are the ones being manipulated, and the ogre charging them is real._

## Scrolls

Scrolls are used by many of the _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ spellcasting Classes. They are a convenient way for casters to have access to additional spells, over and above those they can normally have memorized. Mage scrolls, other than those created by the caster, require the casting of Read Magic before they may be used. Thieves with the Ability to Use Arcane Scrolls may do so without having previously cast Read Magic upon them. Cleric scrolls do not need to have Read Magic cast and may be read by anyone to identify their contents, even a non-spellcaster. They still require a cleric to cast them, however. Protection scrolls may be read and used by anyone regardless of Class.

### Reading a Scroll

Scrolls are useful tools allowing the caster additional spell storage beyond that which can normally be memorized and are categorized by type as follows:

- **Cursed Scrolls:** Cursed scrolls may be either Arcane or Divine and bestow a negative effect upon the reader. These scrolls are activated merely by reading the name or title, or in the case of an Arcane scroll, casting Read Magic upon them. The curse takes effect immediately.
- **Protection Scrolls:** Scrolls of protection may be read even by non-spellcasters and require a single Cast Magic Action on the part of the reader to take effect. The contents of the scroll depend on the nature of its creator, with different practitioners having access to forms of protection, as follows:
  - **Cleric Protection Scrolls:** Demons, Devils, Possession, Undead.
  - **Magic-User Protection Scrolls:** Demons, Elementals, Lycanthropes, Magic, Petrification.
- **Spell Scrolls:** Each spell scroll may contain a single magic-user or cleric spell, regardless of Rank, and each follows the same procedure as casting it normally with regards to Casting Time. However, casting a spell from a scroll requires no expenditure of Magic Points; this price was paid in advance by the scroll's original creator.

A caster may automatically cast any spell from a scroll, assuming they are of the appropriate Class and that they themselves are of sufficient Rank to cast that spell. If they know the spell in question, it requires no skill roll. This causes the spell to disappear from the scroll as the magic is consumed in the spell's casting. A spellcaster may also attempt to cast a spell of a higher Rank, but this requires a successful roll of either Arcane Casting or Divine Channeling as appropriate. A Failure means that the spell is not cast and has been erased from the scroll. On a Fumble, the spell has been miscast. This typically results in the spell affecting the reader and/or one or more allies or having the opposite effect of what was desired.

The difficulty applied to the skill roll is dependent upon the difference between the caster's Rank and the spell's Rank and is detailed in the following table:

##### Scroll Casting Difficulty

| _ **Difference** _ | **Modifier** |
| --- | --- |
| _Spell is of the caster's Rank or lower_ | Spell may be cast with no skill roll |
| _Spell is 1 Rank higher than the caster_ | Spell may be cast with a successful skill roll |
| _Spell is 2 Rank higher than the caster_ | Spell may be cast with a successful Hard skill roll |
| _Spell is 3 Rank higher than the caster_ | Spell may be cast with a successful Formidable skill roll |
| _Spell is 4 Rank higher than the caster_ | Spell may be cast with a successful Herculean skill roll |

### Defending Against a Scroll's Effects

Any harmful magical effects of a scroll may be resisted using the normal methods appropriate to the effects in question. Those resisting may make an Opposed Endurance, Willpower, or Evade roll, vs. the scroll's Magnitude x10. A scroll possesses a Magnitude equal to its Intensity. Note that Resist (Evade) requires the target to have a Combat Action available in order to throw themselves clear.

# Chapter 10: Spells

## Appraise

(Divination)

| **Rank** : Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Turn |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Item | **Resist** : None |

Appraise allows the immediate assessment of the quality of physical goods of combined ENC in 'Things' or SIZ equal to the caster's POW. The spell determines whether identical looking items are of the same or similar quality, or if one or more is either flawed or of a higher quality. The spell does not work on organic things, only on inanimate objects. Neither does it determine what flaws or enhancements are present; merely that they exist. It is of no use in the identification or detection of magic.

## Armor

(Conjuration)

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Round |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : See Below |
| **Cost** : 3+1/Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : None |

When this spell is cast, the subject is gifted with an invisible field of magical force equal to scale armor in protection, granting 4 Armor Points to each Hit Location. It has no effect if cast on someone already wearing armor. It will however supersede natural armor for its Duration, assuming it offers superior protection. If cast on a creature possessing more than 4 points of natural armor, it will instead increase the Armor Points by 1 in all locations. This magical protection does not hinder movement or spell casting. The spell will persist until dispelled by magic, or the caster sustains 8 points of damage from a single attack, +1 per level of additional Intensity (see the table below). Of course, the caster may choose to drop the spell at any time if desired and must do so to sleep.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 4 Armor Points; Sustained until taking 8 damage from 1 attack |
| 2 | 4 | 4 Armor Points; Sustained until taking 9 damage from 1 attack |
| 3 | 5 | 4 Armor Points; Sustained until taking 10 damage from 1 attack |
| 4 | 6 | 4 Armor Points; Sustained until taking 11 damage from 1 attack |
| Continue progression |

## Astral Spell

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Clr 5, Mag 5 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Astral | **Duration** : See Below |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : See Below | **Resist** : N/A |

This spell allows the caster and up to five others (one per additional level of Intensity) to enter the Astral Plane. All must be touching and forming a circle while the spell is cast. The travelers' bodies are left behind in the plane of origin, and they typically do not bring with them any clothing or equipment, except for that which itself radiates a magical aura; these items transform into astral equivalents of their normal form. The Duration lasts until the caster wishes it to cease. However, it is possible for it to be ended prematurely by an outside force such as Dispel Magic. Killing the caster's physical body also ends the spell early, although this has the unfortunate side effect of stranding any travelers accompanying the caster.

## Augury

(Divination)

| **Rank** : Clr 2 | **Casting Time** : 2 Minutes |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Divination | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 3/Intensity | **Range** : 60 ft; |
| **Area** : Caster | **Resist** : N/A |

This spell allows the caster to determine whether a specific action to be taken within the next 30 minutes will be beneficial or detrimental to an individual and/or party's wellbeing. A focal point of some type is required to discern the omens, the most common being the claws or smaller bones of a dragon, a pearl, or pure gold valued at no less than 100 GP in value, which has been crushed or melted down. The spell has a Maximum Intensity of 4. This roll should be made by the Games Master, as the caster should never know beyond a shadow of a doubt whether the results were interpreted correctly.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | Formidable Channel skill roll |
| 2 | 6 | Hard Channel skill roll |
| 3 | 9 | Standard Channel skill roll |
| 4 | 12 | Easy Channel skill roll |

If the divination roll succeeds, it grants one of the following results:

| Yes | The action will be beneficial |
| --- | --- |
| No | The action will be harmful |
| Yes and No | The action will be both beneficial and harmful |
| Nothing | The action will be neither beneficial nor harmful |

A Fumble should result in the Games Master telling the opposite of the reality.

## Avert

(Abjuration)

| **Rank** : Clr 0, Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : Instant |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Protection | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : 60 ft; |
| **Area** : 1 Spell | **Resist** : None |

Avert is used to dismiss another Rank 0 spell within Range. Avert can be cast reactively to neutralize offensive Rank 0 spells, by using the Counter Magic Reactive Action.

## Befuddle

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank** : Clr 0, Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Turn |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Charm | **Duration** : 30 Minutes |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : 60 ft |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : Willpower |

Befuddle causes confusion within the mind of a corporeal target. The subject of the spell has difficulty thinking straight, forgetting where it is, what it is doing, and why – often lapsing into disassociated lines of thought. Befuddled targets can still act in self-defense but cannot initiate any constructive activity until the spell ends. Any sort of attack or threatening action instantly breaks the spell, whether or not it was directed specifically at the befuddled target.

## Blade Barrier

(Evocation)

| **Rank** : Clr 4 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Guardian, Creation | **Duration** : 3 Rounds/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 100 ft |
| **Area** : 5-30 ft. radius | **Resist** : See Below |

This spell creates a barrier of whirling slicing swords, daggers, and knives that whip and slash around a fixed point and cause 1d8 points of damage to 1d4+2 random Hit Locations of _any_ passing through the Area of Effect. Armor only offers half its normal protection. Magic Armor Points reduce damage as normal. Because the weapons whirl around at blinding speed and are tightly packed, it is impossible to Parry or Evade them. One can use a shield to passively block Hit Locations normally. In this case, remember to compare the rolled damage to the armor and Hit Points of the shield.

The spell may be cast defensively to protect the cleric or one or more allies or offensively trap enemies. However, encircled enemies within five feet of the edge of the barrier as it is forming may make an Evade roll to escape. Regardless of success, the opponent ends up prone, just outside the Area of Effect. A successful roll results in no damage; otherwise, they suffer the full effect.

## Bless (Curse)

(Conjuration)

| **Rank** : Clr 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Round |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : All | **Duration** : 5 Minutes |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : 180 ft. |
| **Area** : 25 ft. Radius | **Resist** : Willpower |

When this spell is cast, the cleric blesses a group of allies within the Area of Effect. Those effected radiate the Alignment of the caster, either Good or Evil. There are no blessings of Neutrality. All allies within the spell's radius receive a +5% bonus to all skill and Resistance rolls. In addition, their weapons cause +1d3 damage to intelligent undead as well as creatures from the outer planes that have opposing alignments to that of the caster, such as demons, devils, or angels. Note that while animated undead such as skeletons and zombies are not inherently evil, they are typically animated by evil magic and thus subject to this damage.

The reverse of this spell, Curse, allows the cleric to curse enemies, making the noted skills suffer the inverse of the benefits noted above. A cursed weapon's damage is calculated as a penalty instead, and this damage cannot result in less than 1 point.

## Burning Hands

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : 120-degree Cone, 5 ft. long | **Resist** : Evade |

This spell causes flames to shoot out from the caster's hands in a 120-degree arc. If using miniatures in combat, Burning Hands will damage each target that occupies 1 of the caster's front squares. Casting Burning Hands at higher levels of Intensity requires a higher Rank mage. This damage engulfs all targets within the area with damage based on the spell's Intensity, to a Maximum Intensity of 9, as follows. A successful Evade roll, throwing oneself prone, allows the victim to suffer no damage. Someone with the Artful Dodger Ability has the option to Evade without going prone, but a success in this case will only reduce damage by half unless they are within 5 feet of the edge of the Area of Effect.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Min Rank** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 1 | 1d3+1 points of damage to all Hit Locations |
| 3 | 4 | 1 | 1d3+2 points of damage to all Hit Locations |
| 5 | 5 | 1 | 1d3+3 points of damage to all Hit Locations |
| 7 | 6 | 2 | 1d3+4 points of damage to all Hit Locations |
| 9 | 7 | 3 | 1d3+5 points of damage to all Hit Locations |

Worn armor does not protect, but magical Armor Points or a creature's natural armor reduce damage as normal. This powerful spell is balanced by its noticeably short range, meaning, to cast it, the magic-user must be close enough to be in a very disadvantageous position.

Because larger creatures are typically bigger than the spell's Area of Effect, they will tend to have fewer Hit Locations affected. Those of SIZ 21 to 30 take the damage to their head, chest, abdomen, and arms, while those of SIZ 31+ will take the damage to their abdomen and legs. Games Masters should adjust these locations dependent on the target's shape and position relative to the caster. Burning Hands has a chance of igniting flammable materials equal to the damage rolled x5%. See 'Fires' in chapter 7 for additional information.

## Calm

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank** : Clr 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Charm | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : Willpower |

Calm attempts to dampen down the Passions of a SIZ 1-20 humanoid target, perhaps ensuring that a lovesick paramour does not press his suit, a frightened rival does not scream for help, or that weapons are not drawn in anger. A calmed person is not otherwise mentally affected; thus, any sort of assault or threatening action still permits the target to defend themselves, and even attack, albeit they will do so in a calm and level-headed manner.

## Chain Lightning

(Evocation)

| **Rank** : Mag 4 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 50 ft./Intensity |
| **Area** : See Below | **Resist** : Evade |

Upon casting, the magic-use releases a five-foot-wide bolt of electricity from their fingertips that can strike one target within range for 1d6+1 points of damage per 2 Intensity. The bolt then arcs to the next nearest object or creature, which takes the damage previously rolled minus 1 point, and then arcs to the next nearest, inflicting the damage rolled minus 2 points, and so on. It could even arc back to an ally or the caster! While the initial target must be visible to the caster, targets hit by an arcing bolt do not have to be.

Each arc has its own 50-foot range, which may place the bolt beyond the original range when the spell was cast. Chain Lightning continues to strike if it has damage remaining until it strikes an object that causes it to ground (a metal cage or bars, large pool of water, and so on) or there are no more objects or creatures available to strike.

Each creature struck takes the damage to a single Hit Location, with worn armor offering no protection, and natural armor and magical Armor Points reducing damage as normal.

With a successful Evade roll, throwing oneself prone, the victim suffers no damage. Someone with the Artful Dodger Ability can Evade without going prone, but a Success in this case only reduces damage by half.

Lightning has a chance of igniting flammable materials equal to the damage rolled x1%. See 'Fires' in chapter 7 for additional information. Lightning may also shatter or destroy inanimate objects from sheer impact.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 50-ft range; 1d6+1 damage |
| 2 | 4 | 100-ft range; 1d6+1 damage |
| 3 | 5 | 150-ft range; 2d6+2 damage |
| 4 | 6 | 200-ft range; 2d6+2 damage |
| 5 | 7 | 250-ft range; 3d6+3 damage |
| Continue progression |

## Change Appearance

(Illusion)

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 2d6 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : Caster | **Resist** : N/A |

This spell alters the appearance of the caster to that of any humanoid or person-shaped bipedal form. Height and Weight change is limited to ±5 SIZ, respectively, but within that range, a caster may choose to become fat or thin, tall, or short, or even alter gender. Hair, clothing, and equipment may be changed along with appearance. The caster's facial features may be changed as desired, even to the extent of perfectly imitating another existing person. The spell is subject to disbelief as per other Illusion spells (see page XX). The spell does not alter the caster's scent, and if touched, the caster still feels the same as their original shape and clothing.

## Chant

(Conjuration)

| **Rank** : Clr 2 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Combat | **Duration** : Concentration |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : 30 ft. Radius | **Resist** : N/A |

All those within the Area of Effect receive a +5% bonus to all skill rolls and a +1 bonus to damage, both per level of Intensity. Enemies within the same area suffer the inverse of the benefits noted above.

The Chant must be maintained throughout the spell's Duration or the effects end. The casting ofDispel Magic has no effect on the ongoing effects of Chantas the chanting itself is not magical; however, the casting of Silence nullifies the spell's benefits. The effects of Chant stack with those of both Bless and Curse. Because of the requirement to chant throughout the Duration, casting other spells is impossible.

## Charm Person

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 1 Week/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 360 ft |
| **Area** : 1 1 living human, demi-human, or humanoid | **Resist** : Willpower |

When this spell is cast, one living (undead creatures are unaffected) sapient humanoid target of SIZ 1-20 will cease all hostilities against the magic-user and the magic-user's allies, and instead offer to help and protect them if the target Fails a Resistance roll. Note that helping/protecting can have an unintended or even negative effect for the caster, as the subject acts based on what it feels is the best course of action to protect/help. With regards to commands, a target will never obey suicidal or obviously harmful actions but might be convinced that something extremely dangerous is worth doing.

Any hostile act against the subject of the charm by the magic-user or allies breaks the Enchantment. Note: If others challenge the nature of the Charm, the target may also make a Resistance roll, per the Games Master's discretion. The magic-user must be able to speak with the charmed one to give it any sort of complex 'request'; therefore, knowing the target's language can be important, but not required for the basic Enchantment.

After the initial roll to resist, 1 week must pass before the subject can make another Resistance roll. The effects are ongoing until a successful Resistance roll is made. Casting Charm Person at higher levels of Intensity requires a higher Rank mage and has a maximum Duration of 4 weeks. Throughout the Duration of the spell, the caster's Magic Point total is reduced by the number spent to cast the spell, as per Enduring Magic Costs on page XX.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Min Rank** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 1 | Charmed for 1 week |
| 2 | 4 | 2 | Charmed for 2 weeks |
| 3 | 5 | 3 | Charmed for 3 weeks |
| 4 | 6 | 4 | Charmed for 4 weeks |

## Charm, Mass

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank** : Mag 5 | **Casting Time** : 2 Rounds |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 1 Week/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3/Intensity | **Range** : 40 ft./Intensity |
| **Area** : 20 ft. Radius/Intensity | **Resist** : Willpower |

With the exceptions noted above, this spell functions like the spells Charm Person and Charm Monster. This most powerful of Charm spells has a chance to enthrall all creatures within the Area of Effect of any SIZ. Human-sized and smaller (SIZ 1-20) find their rolls to resist Hard; Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) must make their Resistance rolls at Standard Difficulty, and the resistance roll for Huge creatures (SIZ 41+) is Easy.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | Charmed for 1 week |
| 2 | 6 | Charmed for 2 weeks |
| 3 | 9 | Charmed for 3 weeks |
| 4 | 12 | Charmed for 4 weeks |

## Charm Monster

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank** : Mag 3 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 1 Week/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 180 ft |
| **Area** : 20 ft. Radius | **Resist** : Willpower |

This is an improved version of the spell Charm Person in that it will enthrall all living creatures of SIZ 20 or less within the Area of Effect, or 1 creature of any SIZ. Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) are more difficult to charm, with their resistance roll being Easy, and the resistance roll for Huge creatures (SIZ 41+) is Very Easy. The spell functions in all other ways as per Charm Person.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Min Rank** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 3 | Charmed for 1 week |
| 2 | 4 | 3 | Charmed for 2 weeks |
| 3 | 5 | 4 | Charmed for 3 weeks |
| 4 | 6 | 4 | Charmed for 4 weeks |

## Chill (Heat)

(Evocation)

| **Rank** : Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : None |

Chill dramatically reduces the temperature of a small object with an ENC no greater than 1 'Thing' in size, down to the temperature of ice water. Useful for rapidly cooling hot items, chilling drinks, and so forth. The spell does not freeze an object, and neither does it cause any damage to its structure: it merely renders it very cold.

When reversed, Heat, dramatically increases the temperature of small objects up to the temperature of boiling water. This versatile spell is useful for mulling wine, cooking food without a fire, or warming a bed prior to sleep. It does not affect living tissue although it can affect clothing and armor, making it somewhat uncomfortable, but not to the extent of hindering the wearer.

## Cleanse (Dishevel)

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : See Below | **Resist** : Willpower |

Cleanse is used to rid an object, person or small area of dirt, grease, grime, bad smells, and so on. It does not organize or tidy the target or area; merely cleans them to a spick-and-span state. This spell is often used to launder clothes. The caster can clean up an area equal to POWx5 in square feet (a 5-foot square is 25 square feet).

Dishevel is the reverse of Cleanse. Objects affected are immediately covered in grime, dust, cobwebs, and so forth. The spell can be used to make brand new objects look old and weathered or help prevent normally well-turned-out people from being recognized.

## Command

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank** : Clr 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Charm | **Duration** : 1 Minute |
| **Cost** : 3 | **Range** : 100 ft |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : Willpower |

When this spell is cast, the cleric may utter a single-word command to one living creature of SIZ 1-20, and on the subject's next Turn, the command will be followed to the letter if they fail to resist. This essentially causes the victim to miss the next Turn completing the action commanded and wastes an Action Point while performing it. If the victim possesses no more Action Points, the commanded action will be performed during their first Turn of the next Round. The command itself cannot cause any actual injury to the target; however, injury may come as a secondary effect of the command.

For example, a command to die would result in the victim collapsing in a death-like state for 1 Round causing no actual injury; however, a command to fall given to a creature climbing a 100-foot-high cliff face could be more than deadly.

The subject of the command must be able to understand the language spoken by the caster and is allowed a Willpower test to resist.

| **Some Example Commands** |
| --- |
| Crawl | The subject drops prone and begins to crawl. |
| Die | The subject falls prone entering a comatose death-like state. |
| Fall | The subject falls prone. |
| Fumble | The subject fumbles a physical action about to be taken. |
| Sleep | The subject nods off. |
| Flee | The subject turns and flees the caster. |
| Fly | The subject flaps their arms and runs in circles. |
| Go | The subject starts walking in the direction it was facing. |
| Halt | The subject stops immediately and stands in place. |
| Leave | The subject turns and leaves by the way it entered. |
| Rest | The subject drops to a sitting position and catches its breath. |
| Run | The subject begins to run. |
| Scream | The subject yells. |
| Sink | The subject stops swimming. |
| Surrender | The subject drops its weapons and ceases hostilities. |

## Cone of Cold

(Evocation)

| **Rank** : Mag 3 | **Casting Time** : 1 Round |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : See Below | **Resist** : Evade |

The caster creates a cone of blistering cold extending from their hand. The Area of Effect is a 90-degree arc (a "cone") extending 10 feet in length per level of Intensity. The spell causes 1d6+1 points of damage for each 2 points of Intensity, or fraction thereof, to all victims in the Area of Effect. Roll the damage once and apply it to each of the target's Hit Locations, with worn armor offering only half protection, but a creature's natural armor or magical Armor Points reduce damage as normal. The Games Master may choose the number of locations affected by whatever means they deem appropriate if a huge creature is larger than the Area of Effect.

With a successful Evade roll, throwing oneself prone, the victim suffers no damage. Someone with the Artful Dodger Ability can Evade without going prone, but a Success in this case only reduces damage by half, unless they are within five feet of the edge of the Area of Effect. Cone of Cold has a chance of coating a victim with a layer of ice equal to the rolled damage (after modification) x5%. If frozen, once per Round, the victim may spend an Action Point and make a Brawn roll to attempt to break free; however, until successful, the unfortunate victim cannot move or perform any other actions.

**Cone of Cold Effects**

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 10 ft long; 1d6+1 damage |
| 2 | 4 | 20 ft long; 1d6+1 damage |
| 3 | 5 | 30 ft long; 2d6+2 damage |
| 4 | 6 | 40 ft long; 2d6+2 damage |
| 5 | 7 | 50 ft long; 3d6+3 damage |
| Continue progression |

## Confusion

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank** : Clr 4, Mag 3 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Charm | **Duration** : 1 Minute/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 120 ft. (Cleric version 250 ft) |
| **Area** : 30 ft. Radius | **Resist** : Willpower (Cleric version is Hard Willpower) |

When this spell is cast, 1d4 creatures of SIZ 1-20 within the area of affect that Fail their Resistance roll will be struck with a magical confusion. Each additional level of Intensity will affect another 1d4 creatures to a maximum of 4d4. The cleric version effects 1d3+1 per Intensity and has no Maximum. Those within the Area of Effect and closest to the caster are affected first. A successful Resistance roll overcomes the spell, while a Failed roll results in the victim suffering from one of the following random effects, roll every Round for the spell's Duration, or until the victim wanders off.

| **D100** | **Effects of Confusion** |
| --- | --- |
| 01-10 | Attack the caster with either ranged or melee weapons for the remainder of the Round |
| 11-50 | Stand confused, essentially choosing Dither for the remainder of the Round |
| 51-70 | Attack nearest enemy for the remainder of the Round |
| 71-80 | Attack nearest ally for the remainder of the Round |
| 81-90 | Wander off at Walk speed if unengaged for the Duration of the spell, otherwise Dither as for 11-50 above |
| 91-00 | Act normally for the remainder of the Round |

Each attack on a confused creature allows it an additional attempt to resist the spell. The victim can Evade or Parry normally.

With a 'Wander off' result, the victim heads in the opposite direction to the caster at a walking gait using their normal mode of movement. Creatures with innate Abilities such as astral or ethereal travel, plane shifting, and so on, have a 50% chance of using one of these Abilities in place of their mundane form of movement each Round.

Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) are less susceptible to Confusion, with their Resistance roll being Easy, while the Resistance roll for Huge creatures (SIZ 41+) is Very Easy.

## Continual Light

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Clr 2, Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Sun | **Duration** : Semi-Permanent (See Below) |
| **Cost** : 3 | **Range** : 180 ft. |
| **Area** : 60 ft. Radius | **Resist** : See Below |

This spell creates a globe of light equivalent in brightness to full daylight at a spot of the caster's choosing, which may be an object or even in thin air. It is semi-permanent and may be temporarily negated by entering an area of magical darkness. However, it may be permanently dismissed by the caster at any time or negated by a casting of Darkness or Dispel Magic at an Intensity greater than the Magnitude of Continual Light.

Creatures with an aversion to daylight suffer the normal penalties associated with it when within the relevant Area of Effect. If cast upon a creature, the target is allowed a Willpower test to resist with a success indicating that the spell has affected the area directly behind the creature and not the creature itself. If centered upon a creature's eyes, a Failed Willpower roll results in partial blindness, increasing the difficulty of all skill and Resistance rolls requiring sight by one grade. Sight may only be restored by casting Cure Blindness and Deafness at any Intensity, or by casting Dispel Magic at an Intensity greater than the Magnitude of Continual Light. The effects of the spell are immobile but can be cast on a portable or movable object.

## Control Weather

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Clr 5, Mag 4 | **Casting Time** : 10 Minutes |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Weather | **Duration** : 1d6 Hours/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3+1/Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : 1d4 square miles/Intensity | **Resist** : N/A |

This spell allows the caster to alter the current weather in a significant and noticeable way. Once cast, another 1d4x10 Minutes must pass for the effects to completely manifest. The caster may alter the Precipitation, Temperature, and Wind by up to plus or minus two grades as detailed on the tables on page XX. The Duration of any change is calculated according to the spell's Duration.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 1d6 hr. Duration; 1d4 sq. miles |
| 2 | 4 | 2d6 hr. Duration; 2d4 sq. miles |
| 3 | 5 | 3d6 hr. Duration; 3d4 sq. miles |
| 4 | 6 | 4d6 hr. Duration; 4d4 sq. miles |
| Continue progression |

## Coordination

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Clr 0, Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : All | **Duration** : Trigger |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : None |

Coordination enhances manual dexterity and agility when performing a single predetermined task. When cast in preparation it permits the recipient a chance to re-roll a single skill check where coordination is required, such as Acrobatics, Lockpicking, and so on. The recipient may choose the better of the two rolls, but the spell is expended in the process.

## Create Food and Water

(Alteration)

| **Rank** : Clr 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Minute |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Creation, Elemental (Water) | **Duration** : See Below |
| **Cost** : 3+1/Intensity | **Range** : 30 ft. |
| **Area** : See Below | **Resist** : N/A |

The casting of this spell creates out of thin air, enough food to feed three creatures of SIZ 20 or less or one creature of SIZ 21-40 for an entire day per Intensity. Creatures larger than SIZ 40 require 1 Intensity per 'meal' instead. This creation resembles normal food in all ways, and while rather bland, may be of anything the caster desires. What it lacks in flavor, it more than makes up for in nourishment. Once created, the food has a shelf life of 24 hours regardless of how it is stored. However, once it has gone bad, it may once again be made edible with the casting of Purify Food and Water, extending the period in which it may be safely eaten by another 24 hours. In addition to the food created, the spell creates plenty of drinking water, functioning in all ways as the Rank 1 spell Create Water.

## Cure Disease (Cause Disease)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank** : Clr 2 | **Casting Time** : 1 Round |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Healing | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3/Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : N/A (Endurance or Evade) |

This spell cures the effects of any mundane or magical disease afflicting the target whose Potency is less than the spell's Intensity x30. Once the cure is in effect, recovery can begin as per that noted in the write-up of the disease in question. Afflictions imparted by parasitic creatures such as green slime, rot grubs, and even lycanthropes, can be nullified by Cure Disease. However, with regards to the latter afflictions, Remove Disease must be cast within 72 hours and at an Intensity of 12 or greater, while the former may be cured at an Intensity of only 1. This spell offers no future immunization to the disease.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | Cure a POT 30 disease, green slime, or rot grubs |
| 2 | 6 | Cure a POT 60 disease |
| 3 | 9 | Cure a POT 90 disease |
| 4 | 12 | Cure a POT 120 disease, lycanthropy |
| Continue progression |

The reverse of this spell, Cause Disease, inflicts a magical malady on an enemy. If successful, the caster may choose to inflict any known disease upon the target; however, the Intensity x30 must equal or exceed the Potency of the chosen disease. Once the disease has been successfully inflicted, it functions as per any other disease with regards to resistance, Onset Time, Duration, and so on. The only exception being that early recovery is limited to the casting of either Remove Disease or Cure. The Healing skill has no effects on magically inflicted diseases.

## Cure Fatigue (Cause Fatigue)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank** : Clr 1 | **Casting Time** : 2 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Healing | **Duration** : See Below |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : N/A (Endurance or Evade) |

When this spell is cast, the subject regains 1d3+1 lost levels of Fatigue, even regaining consciousness if applicable.

The reverse of this spell, Cause Fatigue, imparts 1d3+1 levels of Fatigue to targets failing an Endurance roll. The caster's Channel roll functions as the roll to hit their opponent and is assumed part of the spell's somatic requirement. No additional roll to hit is necessary. Neither worn nor natural armor offers any protection, but magical Armor negates the spell.

## Cure Major Wounds (Cause Major Wounds)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank** : Clr 2 | **Casting Time** : 1 Round |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Healing | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3/Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : N/A (Endurance or Evade) |

This spell functions as per Cure Minor Wounds except where noted below.

This spell heals a single Hit Location suffering from a Major Wound, no matter whether it has been crushed or mutilated. It has no effect on a dismembered limb, which requires either Heal, if the limb is still present, or Regeneration to restore it. Provided the recipient is still alive and the location was wounded within a number of hours equal to the Intensity of the spell, then Cure Major Wounds heals 1d8+4 damage almost instantly.

If the injury took place earlier, then the body part must undergo a more traumatic repair, which requires a single casting of Cure Major Wounds and a number of days of full rest and recovery equal to the character's Healing Rate. The rolled Hit Points are averaged out and regained over the course of the noted Recovery Period. If this Recovery Period is interrupted before the healing has completed, the location remains maimed and unusable, only able to be cured by the spell Heal.

When reversed, Cause Major Wounds may be used to reduce a single Hit Location by 1d8+4 Hit Points. The caster's Channel roll functions as the roll to hit their opponent and is assumed part of the spell's somatic requirement. No additional roll to hit is necessary. This spell cannot sever the location but can crush or mutilate it normally. Neither worn nor natural armor offers any protection, but magical Armor Points reduce damage as normal.

## Cure Minor Wounds (Cause Minor Wounds)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank** : Clr 1 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Healing | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3 (or 1) | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : N/A (Endurance or Evade) |

Cure Minor Wounds has several different effects depending on the nature of the ailment it is being used on. When cast on a creature suffering a Minor Wound, 1d4+1 Hit Points in the injured location are healed instantly. It has a limited effect on Serious and Major Wounds, with only a single Hit Point being recovered. However, the spell stabilizes a location regardless of damage, stopping all bleeding and preventing imminent death.

Alternately, if the subject is suffering from a minor complaint, such as a headache, back pain, hangover, cold, warts or so on, the casting of Cure Minor Wounds lifts one of the effects. This instance of the spell costs but a single Magic Point.

When reversed, Cause Minor Wounds reduces the touched location's Hit Points by 1d4+1 points, but otherwise operates in the same manner. Cause Minor Wounds will only inflict 1 point of damage to a location with a Serious or Major Wound, while excess damage is lost. This spell cannot sever the location but can crush or mutilate it normally.

Alternately, the spell may cause a minor malady, such as a headache, back pain, hangover, cold, warts or so on. This instance of the spell costs but a single Magic Point.

The caster's Channel roll functions as the roll to hit their opponent and is assumed part of the spell's somatic requirement. No additional roll to hit is necessary. Neither worn nor natural armor offers any protection, but magical Armor Points reduce damage as normal.

## Cure Serious Wounds (Cause Serious Wounds)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank** : Clr 2 | **Casting Time** : 1 Round |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Healing | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : N/A (Endurance or Evade) |

This spell functions as per Cure Minor Wounds except where noted below.

Cure Serious Wounds heals one Hit Location of 1d6+2 points of injury, provided the injury is no more severe than a Serious Wound. It has a limited effect on Major Wounds, healing the location for 2 Hit Points and stabilizing the injury, preventing death.

When reversed, Cause Serious Wounds reduces a single Hit Location by 1d6+2 Hit Points. Cause Serious Wounds will only cause 2 points of damage to a location with a Major Wound; any excess damage is lost. The caster's Channel roll functions as the roll to hit their opponent and is assumed part of the spell's somatic requirement. No additional roll to hit is necessary. This spell cannot sever the location but can crush or mutilate it normally. Neither worn nor natural armor offers any protection, but magical Armor Points reduce damage as normal.

## Dancing Lights

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 2 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : 100 ft. Radius/Intensity | **Resist** : N/A |

When this spell is cast, the magic-user can create one of the following effects: 1d4 flickering points of light that resemble lanterns or torches, which give off a similar amount of illumination, 1d4 glowing spheres of light-like will-o-wisps, or 1 vaguely humanoid shape of flickering light like that of a fire elemental. The effects may be directed by the caster with no need of Concentration and move at any speed desired within the spell's area. If the lights move out of the spell's Area of Effect, or the Duration expires, they wink out of existence.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 1d4 lights or 1 shape for 2 min. in a 100 ft. radius |
| 2 | 2 | 1d4 lights or 1 shape for 4 min. in a 200 ft. radius |
| 3 | 3 | 1d4 lights or 1 shape for 6 min. in a 300 ft. radius |
| 4 | 4 | 1d4 lights or 1 shape for 8 min. in a 400 ft. radius |
| Continue progression |

## Darkness

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 10 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 30 ft./Intensity |
| **Area** : 10 ft. Radius | **Resist** : N/A |

This spell creates an area of total magical darkness in a 10-foot radius, blocking normal vision as well as special racial sight like Infravision. All forms of mundane light are nullified by this spell, from sunlight to candlelight. It may be countered by the casting of Light and vice versa; however, other forms of magical light such as Dancing Lights, Fairy Fire, and even the glow given off by Detection spells are nullified by Darkness. A Light spell with an already ongoing Duration has no effect on Darkness and vice versa.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 10 min.; 30 ft. Range |
| 2 | 2 | 20 min.; 60 ft. Range |
| 3 | 3 | 30 min.; 90 ft. Range |
| 4 | 4 | 40 min.; 120 ft. Range |
| Continue progression |

## Darkvision

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 1 Minute |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 2 Hours/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : N/A |

This spell grants the recipient Darkvision to a Range of 60 feet. It functions in all ways as the racial Ability of the same name.

## Death Spell

(Necromancy)

| **Rank** : Mag 4 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Instantaneous |
| **Cost** : 3+1/Intensity, +2 EXP | **Range** : 30 ft./Intensity |
| **Area** : 15 ft. Radius | **Resist** : Endurance |

The successful casting of this spell kills a variable number of creatures SIZ 40 or less in the Area of Effect. The magic-user rolls 1d6 for each level of Intensity to determine the number of creatures affected. Where creatures of differing SIZ categories occupy the Area of Effect, human-sized creatures (SIZ 1-20) are always affected before larger ones. Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) are more likely to resist being killed, with their Resistance roll being Easy, however, each Large creature counts as 5 human-sized creatures. Creatures larger than SIZ 40 are unaffected by this spell.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 +2 EXP | 30 ft. Range; 1d6 creatures affected |
| 2 | 4 +2 EXP | 60 ft. Range; 2d6 creatures affected |
| 3 | 5 +2 EXP | 90 ft. Range; 3d6 creatures affected |
| 4 | 6 +2 EXP | 120 ft. Range; 4d6 creatures affected |
| Continue progression |

Casting the spell at sufficient Intensity to equal or exceed the number of protentional targets is desirable, as insufficient points are lost. This spell has no effect on lycanthropes, undead, or other planar creatures. Only a Wish can bring those affected by this spell back from the dead.

Example: Rengarth casts the Death Spell into an area occupied by four SIZ 16 orcs and two SIZ 32 hill giants, choosing an Intensity of 3. Rolling 3d6 for the spell's effects, with 1d6 per Intensity, results in 12 points. While each hill giant requires only 5 points to be killed, the smaller orcs are the first affected. Three of the four orcs Fail their Resistance roll and succumb to death. As each orc is equal to 1 point, 8 points remain. This is enough to affect a single hill giant for 5 points, with the remaining 3 points being lost. However, the angry hill giant has no problem succeeding at its Easy Resistance roll and charges at Rengarth.

## Deflect

(Evocation)

| **Rank** : Clr 0, Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Protection | **Duration** : Concentration |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : None |

Deflect wards the recipient against tiny impacts of foreign material, such as raindrops, a cloud of midges, or even flying grains of sand. The protection is limited to individual objects smaller than a child's fingernail, and thus cannot prevent normal missile weapons from striking a character.

## Detect Charm (Hide Charm)

(Divination)

| **Rank** : Clr 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Round |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Divination | **Duration** : 2 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 100 ft. |
| **Area** : 1 Target per Minute | **Resist** : N/A |

This spell allows the caster to discern if one or more selected creatures are under the effects of Charm. A full minute's Concentration is required to scan one creature. When the reverse of this spell (Hide Charm) is cast, one creature may be shielded from such detection for 6 hours/Intensity.

## Detect Evil (Detect Good)

(Divination)

| **Rank** : Clr 1, Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : All | **Duration** : 5 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 180 ft. |
| **Area** : 90-degree Arc | **Resist** : N/A |

With this spell, the caster can detect strong emanations of evil within a 90-degree Arc,out to 180 feet. It will only discover evil creatures of a supernatural nature like demons and vampires, or mundane beings of either evil or vile intention, as determined by the Games Master. It will not, however, detect such things as traps, poison, cursed items, or so on. The caster can see the emanations through up to 3 feet of solid wood, 1 foot of stone or dirt, and 1 inch of solid metal. Because the magical auras need time to form, no more than one 60° arc may be scanned per minute. The reverse of this spell, Detect Good, follows the same rules noted above.

## Detect Invisibility

(Divination)

| **Rank** : Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 5 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : Line of Sight | **Resist** : N/A |

When this spell is cast, the magic-user gains the ability to see any objects or beings that are invisible. This includes those that are hidden, ethereal, astral, or out of phase. It may also detect those hidden or concealed by mundane means. Unlike other Detect spells, Detect Invisibility is limited to line of sight and does not require a minute to scan an arc of vision.

## Detect Lie (Conceal Lie)

(Divination)

| **Rank** : Clr 2 | **Casting Time** : 1 Round |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Divination | **Duration** : 1 Minute/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 100 ft. |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : Deceit |

When cast, this spell determines whether one being is knowingly lying or otherwise withholding the truth. The actual truth is not revealed, however, only that the answers being provided are not accurate. The target may still attempt to 'beat' the spell, with a Formidable Opposed Roll of their Deceit, vs. the original casting roll. The spell may be reversed, if so, Conceal Lie prevents detection of lies by magical means for a period of 6 hours per Intensity.

## Detect Magic

(Divination)

| **Rank** : Clr 1, Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : All | **Duration** : 2 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : 90-degree Arc, 60 ft. | **Resist** : N/A |

When cast, the magic-user sees a glowing blue aura surrounding any magic item or spell effect within a 90-degree arc,out to 60 ft. This spell will also detect approximate Intensity and Magnitude as shown on the following table.

**Intensity and/or Magnitude Detected**

| **D100 Roll** | **Intensity/Magnitude** |
| --- | --- |
| 01-25 | -1d3 |
| 26-75 | Exact Intensity/Magnitude |
| 76-00 | +1d3 |

There is a 10% chance per Intensity of discovering the specific type of magic (necromancy, elemental, and so forth). The aura the caster sees projects through solid objects, up to 3 feet of wood, 1 foot of stone, and 1 inch of solid metal. Because the magical auras need time to form, no more than one 60° arc may be scanned per minute. Demons, devils, angels, and elementals are not magical in and of themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell will register for a number of minutes equal to the summoning spell's Magnitude x10 where it was cast.

## Dimension Door

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 3 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : Caster | **Resist** : N/A |

Dimension Door is a form of short-range teleportation. The caster instantly jumps up to 100 feet per Intensity without crossing the intervening space, with no chance of error. The desired location may either be visually seen or may be specified by direction: 40 feet straight ahead, 65 feet down, 45° to the left, and so on. Arriving in mid-air will result in falling damage unless saved by a spell such as Feather Fall, while accidentally jumping into a solid object will instead trap the caster in the Astral Plane. All physically carried equipment (non-living, inanimate matter) jumps along with the caster. Living matter of no more than 20 SIZ may accompany the caster. For example, a character of SIZ 11 may jump along with the caster assuming both are touching. The caster, and any living creature transported as well, requires a full Round to recover. If attacked during this time, such individuals may do no more than defend.

## Dispel Magic

(Abjuration)

| **Rank** : Clr 2, Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Protection | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : 360 ft. |
| **Area** : 15 ft. Radius | **Resist** : N/A |

Dispel Magic may be cast against either a specific target or a noted area, and once cast, all magic within a 15-foot radius of the target point is susceptible to dismissal. It ends ongoing spells on its target but does nothing to other magical effects. It has no effect on magical creatures or the undead. Dispel Magic eliminates all other magic in the Area of Effect with a Magnitude less than the spell's Intensity. The exception to this would be magic items and victims of beguiling-type spells such as Charm Person, which must be targeted individually. A spell's effects cannot be partially eliminated.

Dispel Magic starts with the most powerful magic in the Area of Effect. If it fails to eliminate any spell (because the spell's Magnitude is too high), then the spell ends, and no more magic can be eliminated.

Dispel Magic may be used defensively to neutralize incoming offensive spells, by using the Counter Spell Reactive Action.

## Divination

(Divination)

| **Rank** : Clr 3 | **Casting Time** : 10 Minutes |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Divination | **Duration** : Concentration |
| **Cost** : 3/Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : See Below | **Resist** : N/A |

When cast, this spell allows clerics to receive information from their deity regarding some so far untaken activity expected to occur in no more than one week. Unlike the less powerful spell Augury, Divination provides specific information. The Channel skill roll to cast this spell starts at Formidable, and each level of Intensity decreases the difficulty by one grade. The Intensity cannot exceed level 5, and a roll of 96% or higher always fails.

The Games Master should make this roll for the player as there are some instances where magic hostile to the caster could be at work, and in these instances, a Failure could reveal false information.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | Spell cast at Formidable difficulty |
| 2 | 6 | Spell cast at Hard difficulty |
| 3 | 9 | Spell cast at Standard Difficulty |
| 4 | 12 | Spell cast at Easy difficulty |
| 5 | 16 | Spell cast at Very Easy difficulty |

## Dry

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : N/A |

Dry removes all extraneous moisture from an object or person, either slicking off to form a puddle or evaporating in a cloud of vapor. It is normally used to dry off after heavy rain or help protect equipment from rotting but has several other versatile uses. The caster can dry an object up to POW x2 in SIZ.

## Earthquake

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Clr 5, Mag 5 | **Casting Time** : 10 Minutes1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Elemental (Earth) | **Duration** : 1 Minute |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 50 ft./Intensity |
| **Area** : 10 ft. Radius/Intensity | **Resist** : N/A |

Earthquake causes a ground tremor capable of knocking people from their feet and collapsing rigid buildings. At the very minimum, failing to resist the spell causes the victim to fall prone. If located within a building, built up area or some vulnerable location (such as a forest or beneath a cliff), failing to Evade also indicates that the person is struck, and trapped by falling debris. Use the size of the damage dice in a Contest of Strength (see Brawn) to determine the difficulty of being extracted from the wreckage. Worn armor offers half protection, but magical Armor Points or a creature's natural armor reduce damage as normal.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** | **Potential Damage** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 50 ft. Range; 10 ft. radius; Delicately balanced objects topple, suspended objects swing. | None |

## Enchant Item

(Enchantment)

| **Rank** : Mag 4 | **Casting Time** : See Below |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : See Below |
| **Cost** : 3 + See Below | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Item | **Resist** : N/A |

The casting of this spell prepares an item for Enchantment. The object must be in good condition and of the finest construction and workmanship. An additional cost of at least 100 GP is required to cover the cost of additional tooling, carving, embroidery, bejeweling, engraving, and so. Finally, the Enchantment process requires a laboratory or workshop.

While casting the spell, the magic-user must be touching the item throughout the entire Casting Time of 1d8+2 days. This accounts for periods of rest and sleep, during which time the item must remain within an arm's length of the caster. At no time throughout the casting may the magic-user cast another spell or perform any other form of magic. Breaking any of these strictures will automatically cause the spell to fail.

Once successfully cast, the item is ready for the final step, with the caster placing the desired spell into it. To do so, they must have the spell in memory or on a scroll and cast it into the item within 24 hours, or the entire process will need to be started over from scratch. Once the casting of the selected spell begins, the process may exceed the above-mentioned 24 hours. Imbuing the item with the selected spell costs the normal number of Magic Points for the desired Intensity and takes 1d12 hours per spell Rank. Throughout the imbuing process, the caster must remain touching the item or remain within arm's reach during periods of rest, as above, and an Arcane Casting roll is required at the end of the casting period to successfully imbue the spell. The normal Spell Casting degrees of success are followed, however, with regards to a Failure result, the spell cannot be forced. Successive spells may be imbued within the item, providing the casting process is started within 24 hours of the completion of the previous spell. This applies even in the case of a previously failed spell. Each successive spell requires the normal Casting Cost.

When using the item, each spell contained within may be cast only once, however multiple versions of the same spell may be imbued following the above procedure. It is also possible to imbue a single spell, following it with a casting of the Rank 4 spell Permanency. In this case, the spell may be cast as often as desired, following the restrictions set forth under the Permanency spell write-up.

It is not possible to imbue other magical effects into an item that do not conform to a specific spell, and many magic items from times long gone simply cannot be recreated in this day and age.

## Enchant Weapon

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 3 | **Casting Time** : 1 Minute |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 5 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Weapon | **Resist** : N/A |

When this spell is cast while touching a normal weapon, the weapon is instilled with a temporary Enchantment granting a magical +1 Damage Modifier. This also allows an otherwise normal weapon to strike a creature only able to be harmed by weapons possessing at least a +1 Enchantment. The spell may be used to enchant two weapons equal in size to ½ a 'Thing' each, such as daggers, knives, arrows, and so on. Otherwise, no more than a single weapon may be enchanted per casting. An existing magic weapon may have its bonus increased by +1 to a total maximum combined bonus of +3. A weapon with a +3 bonus has its Size increased by one category for the purposes of inflicting damage: Large to Huge, Huge to Enormous, Enormous to Colossal. An Enchanted Weapon possesses +5 Armor Points and +2 Hit Points per +1 Enchantment for a weapon of its type. This spell may be combined with the spell's Enchant Item and Permanency to create a weapon with a lasting Enchantment.

## Endure Heat/Cold

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Clr 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Round |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Protection | **Duration** : 90 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : N/A |

This spell allows the caster to protect one creature from normal extremes of heat or cold, as determined when the spell is cast. The recipient of the spell is immune to mundane extremes of natural heat or cold, such as subzero temperatures or sweltering desert heat. Apart from Heat Metal, to which this spell offers complete protection, any 'attack' by magical heat or cold, such as a red dragon's flame breath or a mage's cone of cold spell automatically dispels the protection, regardless of which element was protected against at the time. However, the protected individual may ignore the first 10 points of damage in the Round in which the spell fails, assuming the protection fits the attack type. In the case of area effect spells, the damage is reduced before being applied.

## Energy Drain

(Evocation or Necromancy)

| **Rank** : Mag 5 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : Endurance |

When cast, this spell imposes two levels of permanent Fatigue loss on the victim of a Failed Resistance roll. Fatigue loss through Energy Drain is cumulative with normal Fatigue loss; therefore, opponents already weakened through combat or travel are more susceptible to Energy Drain. Cure Fatigue spells and potions do not affect Fatigue lost due to Energy Drain; however, Restoration spells and scrolls can permanently cure the lost Fatigue. Armor has no effect on Energy Drain.

## Exorcism

(Abjuration)

| **Rank** : Clr 3 | **Casting Time** : 1d10x100 Minutes |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Protection | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 10 ft. |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : Willpower |

By means of this spell, clerics call upon their deity to drive out a spirit or other supernatural force currently possessing a corporeal being such as in demonic possession. Exorcism may also be used against domination by certain objects and magic items, spells, curses, and even charms. Whether the possession is dominant, or covert is immaterial. The magic exorcises all forms of possession with an Intensity of up to half the Intensity of the spell. What occurs next depends on the attitude and type of entity, if any, but belligerent ones with the power to discorporate may be tempted to engage other nearby targets in Spirit Combat. Treat as a Magic Dual, however, if the entity wins, they may possess the loser. If the entity loses, it is sent back to its plane of origin. Thus, this spell can be potentially dangerous for the caster or their fellows. The Casting Time is very random and cannot be interrupted without disrupting the ritual.

## Fear

(Illusion)

| **Rank** : Mag 3 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : See Below |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : 5 ft. x 20 ft. Cone | **Resist** : Willpower |

When this spell is cast, a wave of terror expands outward, causing all those who Fail a Resistance roll to flee in fear. Those so affected flee directly away from the caster at sprinting speed for a number of Rounds equal to the spell's Intensity x2. This terror is so all-consuming that those opponents who Fumble the roll to resist drop any held items that are not secured in some fashion. Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) are less susceptible to this spell with the Resistance roll being Easy, and the Resistance roll for Huge creatures (SIZ 41+) is Very Easy.

## Feather Fall

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : Instant |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 1 Minute/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 30 ft./Intensity |
| **Area** : 5 ft. Radius | **Resist** : N/A |

When this spell is cast, several people, creatures, or objects within the spell's Area of Effect, with a combined SIZ totaling no more than 20 per Intensity, are reduced in weight to that of a feather. Those under the spell's influence fall no faster than 10 ft. per Round/120 ft. per minute, with no falling damage incurred while the spell's Duration continues. They are so light as to be effectively immune to any knockback greater than 5 ft. and take no damage if knocked into anything, as they simply float slowly backward.

Casting this spell on an aerial creature such as a bird or dragon changes its flight dynamic in such a way that Hard Fly rolls are required every Round of the spell's Duration if they wish to remain aloft. On a success, the creature may move as desired, but at only half its normal Movement Rate, while a Failed roll causes the creature's attempt to send it gently tumbling out of control in a random direction at a distance equal to its attempted rate of movement. If it simply lets itself fall, an aerial creature may use its wings to adjust its point of landing by 5 ft. per Round.

If the spell wears off before those affected have landed, they resume normal falling speed and determine falling damage from that point.

Due to this spell's Instant Casting Time, the mage may use Feather Fall reactively as well as proactively. This allows the spell to protect from unexpected falls or even to interrupt another's Action to slow-propelled projectiles such as arrows or hurled spears, which then gently float to the ground between the attacker and target, causing no damage.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 min.; 30 ft. Range; total affected 20 SIZ; total decent 120 ft |
| 2 | 2 | 2 min.; 60 ft. Range; total affected 40 SIZ; total decent 240 ft |
| 3 | 3 | 3 min.; 90 ft. Range; total affected 60 SIZ; total decent 360 ft |
| 4 | 4 | 4 min.; 120 ft. Range; total affected 80 SIZ; total decent 480 ft |

## Find Familiar

(Conjuration)

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 2d12 Hours |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Special |
| **Cost** : 3/Intensity, +1 EXP | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : ½ Mile Radius/Intensity | **Resist** : N/A |

This spell allows the caster to attempt to summon a familiar, which becomes an extension of its master's senses and power. Familiars may converse with their master telepathically and make good guards and scouts as well. Having one's familiar killed presents certain risks to the magic-user due to their close connection, which makes having a familiar a low-rank danger.

To summon a familiar, the magic-user must begin the ritual while keeping a brazier stoked with charcoal, and when burning with intensity, add 100 GP worth of incense. With these ingredients burning, the caster must then continue the ritual until the familiar arrives or the Casting Time expires without success.

Even if this spell is successfully cast, the chance of a suitable familiar answering the magic-user's call is only 50%, and the magic-user may only attempt this spell once a year. Each additional level of Intensity beyond the first extends the Range of the spell another half mile, which in turn increases the likelihood of a potential familiar being found by 5%, to a maximum of 95%. There is no control over the exact type of creature that will answer the call, but what does arrive will be a faithful servant and ally. It is up to the specific creature to answer the call, therefore being in a region known to be inhabited by a certain type of creature does _not_ assure the caster of success.

If a creature answers the caster's summons, the magic-user need still sacrifice 1 Experience Roll to create a spiritual link between themselves and the familiar. Once this is done, the ritual is complete.

While the familiar and his master are within 120 ft. of each other, the magic-user gains the ability to use the familiar's Magic Points as well. In addition, the magic-user gains a telepathic link with the familiar and any additional special Abilities or skill bonuses noted on the tables below.

In the case of the familiar's death, the caster loses 5 Experience Rolls. A caster not currently having any Experience Rolls must forfeit all further Experience Rolls awarded until the balance is paid.

The type of familiar to appear, if any, is determined according to the following table. Under most circumstances, common familiars are not exceptionally large, being between SIZ 1-4, and use the Small Animal write-up.

### Common Familiars

## Fireball

(Evocation)

| **Rank** : Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Concentration |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 20 ft. Radius | **Resist** : None |

On the first Turn of casting, as the magic-user begins the verbal incantation and gestures, a small cinder or spark-sized flame begins to form in the hand, slowly enlarging to a small ball of fire. On the second Turn, the incantation complete, the magic-user mimes tossing the ball, which detonates with a low roar into a massive ball of fire. It possesses little pressure and delivers 1d6 points of damage for each 2 points of Intensity, or fraction thereof, to all victims in the Area of Effect. The damage is rolled once and is applied to each of the target's Hit Locations, with worn armor offering no protection, but magical Armor Points or a creature's natural armor reduce damage as normal.

A successful Evade roll, resulting in going prone, allows the victim to suffer no damage. Someone with the Artful Dodger Ability has the option to Evade without going prone, but a success in this case will only reduce damage by half unless they are within 5 feet of the edge of the Area of Effect.

A Fireball has a chance of igniting flammable materials equal to the damage rolled x5%. See 'Fires' on page XX for additional information.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 30 ft. Range; 1d6 damage |
| 2 | 4 | 60 ft. Range; 1d6 damage |

## Fireball, Delayed Blast

(Evocation)

| **Rank** : Mag 4 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : See Below |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 50 ft./Intensity |
| **Area** : 20 ft. Radius | **Resist** : Evade |

With the exceptions noted both above and in the following text, this spell functions as per the normal Fireball spell. The Delayed Blast Fireball inflicts 1d8 points of damage for each 2 points of Intensity, or fraction thereof, to all victims in the Area of Effect. When cast, the magic-user can set the Fireball to detonate at any time between instantly and within five minutes. It traverses to the designated spot and then remains inert, a tiny floating cinder, until at the desired time when it flashes into a massive ball of flame.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 50 ft. Range; 1d8 damage |
| 2 | 4 | 100 ft. Range; 1d8 damage |

## Fire Shield

(Evocation)

| **Rank** : Mag 3 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 2 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : Caster | **Resist** : N/A |

This spellcreates a shield of wispy flames that immolates the caster or one other person but causes no damage in and of itself. Instead, the flames protect the recipient from either fire or cold, dependent upon which of two variants is in memory: Chill Shield, which creates blue or green flames and protects against heat and fire-based damage, or Warm Shield, which creates violet or blue flames and protects against cold and ice-based damage. The color of the flames should be determined randomly with a 50% chance of either, as the fact that both types can emit blue flames creates an element of uncertainty on the part of any attacker. The decision as to which to memorize is made when spells are prepared, and both may be memorized if desired. These flames give off no heat and shed light at only half the brightness of a torch. The specifics of each variant are detailed below.

- **Chill Shield:** These flames are cool to the touch and reduce any fire or heat-based damage to half the total. A successful Resistance roll will negate all damage. The Resistance roll is one grade easier and, in the case of Evade, will not render the defender prone.
- **Warm Shield:** These flames are warm to the touch and reduce any cold-based damage to half of the total. A successful Resistance roll will negate all damage. The Resistance roll is one grade easier and in the case of Evade, will not render the defender prone.

Melee attacks against the recipient of either variant, whether armed or unarmed, inflict normal damage unless using one of the elements protected against. In this case, the caster is protected from the elemental portion of the attack, and the attacker receives damage equal to that inflicted. Worn armor on the part of the attacker offers no protection, but magical Armor Points or a creature's natural armor reduce damage as normal. Creatures with Innate Magic Resistance can dispel Fire Shield on a successful Willpower roll when the recipient is first struck. If the Magic Resistance roll Fails, the opponent cannot later negate the Fire Shield.

## Flame Strike

(Evocation)

| **Rank** : Clr 2 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Combat, Elemental (Fire) | **Duration** : Instantaneous |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 100 ft.+20ft./additional Intensity |
| **Area** : 5 ft. Radius | **Resist** : Evade |

Upon successfully casting, a column of flame 30 feet in height streaks down from above, scorching an area the cleric designates. The column does 1d8 points of damage for each 2 points of Intensity, or fraction thereof, to all victims in the Area of Effect. Roll the damage once and apply it to each of the target's Hit Locations, with worn armor offering half protection, but magical Armor Points or a creature's natural amour reduce damage as normal. A successful Evade roll, rolling or throwing oneself out of the Area of Effect and ending up prone, allows the victim to suffer no damage. Someone with the Artful Dodger Ability can Evade without going prone and is allowed to freely move just outside of the Area of Effect.

Flame Strike has a chance of igniting flammable materials equal to the damage rolled x5%. See 'Fires' on page XX for additional information.

## Flesh to Stone (Stone to Flesh)

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 4 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3/Intensity | **Range** : 30 ft./Intensity |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : Willpower |

When cast, one victim within Range is allowed a Willpower Resistance roll. If unsuccessful, they and all carried and worn belongings are completely transformed into solid stone. This transformation is not death, but instead a form of suspended animation. The casting of either the reversed version of this spell, or a Wish, may be used to restore the victim to life once again. Any damage the victim suffers while stone carries over, taking effect immediately upon restoration. Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) are less susceptible to this spell with the Resistance roll being Easy, and the Resistance roll for Huge creatures (SIZ 41+) is Very Easy.

The reverse of this spell, Stone to Flesh, is used to restore a victim and no roll to resist is necessary. However, the spell may also be reversed to transform stone that was never previously alive; being used in one of several creative ways. For example, a wall of stone 10 cubic feet in size per level of Intensity may be transformed into soft. flesh, a 'tunnel' of flesh up to 3 feet wide, with a length of 10 feet per Intensity could be created, a single target such as a stone statue could be transformed into a body, and even a stone golem could be transformed into a flesh golem by means of this spell. However, in the latter case, the stone golem would be allowed a Willpower roll to resist as normal. Stone turned to flesh in this way is soft. and pliable, and while it retains its actual Hit Points, possesses no Armor Points, thus making it easier to hack apart.

## Floating Disk

(Conjuration)

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 30 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 60 ft. |
| **Area** : 3 ft. wide disk | **Resist** : N/A |

The magic-user may cast this spell to create a shimmering disk of force concentrated into a circle 3 feet in diameter, and use it to carry loose, miscellaneous items. This floating disk will always remain 3 feet above the ground and can carry any number of goods if they do not exceed 20 'Things' per Intensity and can fit upon the disk. For comparative purposes, assume 1 SIZ is equal to 3 'Things'; therefore, the disk would be able to carry just over 6 SIZ per Intensity. The concave nature of the disk will generally keep items from rolling off and if left unbidden, the disk will stay within 5 feet of the caster, following with a Movement Rate of 15 feet. However, the disk may be maneuvered to any point within the 60-foot area of the spell if the magic-user concentrates, even being willed to remain at a certain location. If the magic-user allows the disk to move beyond 60 feet, the disk will wink out of existence, dropping all carried items to the ground. The disk may not be willed to rise more than 3 feet off the ground.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 30 min.; carry 1-20 'Things' |
| 2 | 2 | 60 min.; carry 21-40 'Things' |

| 4 | 4 | 120 min.; carry 61-80 'Things' |

| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : N/A |

When this spell is cast, the magic-user may grant one creature of up to 10 SIZ per Intensity the gift. of flight. The creature gains a Movement Rate of 30 feet while flying, half that if climbing and double that in a dive. All skill penalties applying to ground movement speed apply to the desired flying speed as well, including limitations placed on spell casting and combat. The exact Duration of the Fly spell is unpredictable and should be rolled by the Games Master as those under its effects should not know specifically how much time is left. If the flier is required to make a Fly skill roll, Athletics or Acrobatics may be substituted at two grades of difficulty. However, a character that uses this spell frequently may choose to develop the Fly skill normally at a Base Value of STR+DEX.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |

When cast, this spell allows the subject to act normally throughout its Duration, regardless of other spells or effects that hinder movement or penalize attacks. This includes negating penalties from impeding terrain such as mud and snow. Under water, the subject may move at their normal land speed and swung weapons (swords, axes, clubs, maces, and so on) attack with full effect. This spell does not grant the ability to breath under water, however. This spell negates hindering spells, such as Entangle, Slow, Hold, Paralysis, Web, and so on, regarding movement and action penalties.

| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : Endurance |

Frostbite works directly on living, organic tissue, inflicting numbness, and pain in one of the recipient's extremities, for example fingers, toes, buttocks, nose & ears, and so on. The caster must either touch a specific extremity or roll randomly if cast at Range. If the spell is not resisted the area affected suffers sensory numbness followed by lingering pain for the Duration, making skill tests utilizing that location one Difficulty Grade harder. Frostbite does not deal direct damage but makes the affected area of limited use for a while. For instance, a victim suffering frostbite to the buttocks cannot sit without extreme discomfort.

Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) are less susceptible to this spell with the Resistance roll being Easy, and the Resistance roll for Huge creatures (SIZ 41+) is Very Easy.

## Fumble

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank** : Mag 3 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 1 Round/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 30 ft./Intensity |
| **Area** : 10 ft. Radius | **Resist** : Willpower |

This spell causes all opponents in the Area of Effect to become clumsy, with any physical skill rolls becoming one grade more difficult and causing all failures to result in a Fumble. Even physical actions that do not typically require a skill roll such as picking up a dropped item, moving faster than a walk, or climbing stairs require an Athletics skill roll. A Failure in this case results in a Fumble, and typically an awkward fall in the case of movement, or accidentally kicking an item further away while attempting to pick it up. The Games Master should be creative with the results of a Fumbled roll; however, few should be outright deadly in non-combat situations. In combat, however, a Fumble is treated as any other and can result in Special Effects as normal.

A successful Resistance roll allows the victim to avoid the effects of the spell for the current Round; however, if the victim still occupies the Area of Effect next Round, another roll to Resist must be made again as normal. Allies of the original attacker will also need to stay out of the Area of Effect or suffer the same limitations as their opponents.

This spell may also be targeted on a specific creature, who will suffer the effects for the spell's entire Duration on a Failed Resistance roll. Cast in this way, Fumble produces no Area of Effect. In this case, a successful Resistance roll results in the victim suffering the effects of the Rank 2 spell, Slow.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 1 Round; 30 ft. Range |
| 2 | 4 | 2 Rounds; 60 ft. Range |
| 3 | 5 | 3 Rounds; 90 ft. Range |
| 4 | 6 | 4 Rounds; 120 ft. Range |
| Continue progression |

## Gate

(Conjuration)

| **Rank** : Clr 5, Mag 5 | **Casting Time** : 2 Rounds |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Summoning | **Duration** : See Below |
| **Cost** : 3+1/Intensity,+3 EXP | **Range** : 100 ft. |
| **Area** : See Below | **Resist** : Willpower |

The casting of Gate requires the caster to know the true name of the entity to be summoned, which is typically a creature from one of the other planes of existence, such as a demon or devil, an angel, demi-god or even a god. When successfully cast, a portal opens between the caster's plane of occupancy and that of the entity. Casting the spell automatically gains the entity's attention whether successful or otherwise. This spell is immensely powerful and draining, costing the caster not only the noted 3 Magic Points and 3 Experience Rolls, but also Aging them 5% of their typical lifespan (5 years in the case of a human caster). If the entity succeeds at the Resistance roll, they typically will not bother to come in person, however, assuming the spell is successful, 'something' will come through. The following table is used to determine some common entities, their average Willpowers, and typical servants that would be sent in their place. The Games Master is free to choose as best fits the nature of the current campaign.

**Extra Planar Entity Table**

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** | **Willpower** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | Sub-Demon or Sub-Devil | As per specific entity |
| 2 | 4 | Minor Demon or Devil | As per specific entity |
| 3 | 5 | Lesser Demon or Devil | As per specific entity |
| 4 | 6 | Greater Demon or Devil | As per specific entity |
| 5 | 7 | Demon/Devil Prince or Duke, Arch Angel, or Demi-god | 121-140% |
| 6 | 8 | Demon Lord, Arch-Devil, or Lesser Deity | 141-160% |
| 7 | 9 | Greater Deity | 161-180% |
| 8 | 10 | Ruling Deity | 181% + |

The form of the response will depend greatly on the specific entity, the Alignment of both parties, and the specifics of the request. If the entity believes the reasons for the interruption to be petty or inconsequential, their response could be anything from simply leaving to outright attack. However, a desperate situation, especially one where the caster is threatened by something strongly opposed by the entity is likely to be met with a more favorable response. If the Games Master feels there is a gray area, and the response would be in question, the caster and their allies may attempt to argue their case using a combination of skill, flattery, pleading, and/or bribery. However, most entities will avoid being drawn into a conflict with others of equal or greater power, and many will demand payment, either before or after the deed. The gate will stay open for as long as the entity chooses to remain on this side, closing behind them when they decide to leave. During this time, it is possible for the gate to be traversed by others, offering two-way travel between both realities.

## Glamour (Repugnance)

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank** : Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Concentration |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : 60 ft. |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : Willpower |

Glamour makes the target alluring so that people are naturally attracted to them. The nature of the glamour must be chosen when cast, and can be anything from increased natural beauty, a softer sultrier voice, or even a seductively perfumed body scent. While the spell grants no mechanical benefits, it does ensure that the recipient will gain a chance to gather themselves an audience, engage the attention of someone they wish to contact, or provide a distraction enabling accomplices an opportunity to perform nefarious deeds.

When reversed, Repugnance twists the appearance of the target so that they cause distaste in all those that see, hear, or smell them. The effect must be chosen when cast and can be anything from a great wart on the end of a nose, a high-pitched nasal voice or even pungent body odor. Whatever is chosen, it will cause people to turn away from the victim or make excuses to leave their presence as quickly as possible.

## Glue

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 24 Hours |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 2 Items or 1 Broken Item | **Resist** : N/A |

Glue cements together two solid, inanimate objects for the Duration of the spell, for example a cartwheel to its axle, or a door to its frame. While under the effects of the spell the items, no matter how disparate, cannot be parted unless something actively tries to wrench them apart. In this circumstance the spell has a Brawn skill equal to the caster's POW x5 and fails when a superior Brawn is set against it, defeating it in an Opposed Roll. Once the spell concludes or fails, the items part, completely unharmed.

## Haste

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 3 Rounds/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 180 ft. |
| **Area** : 20 ft. Radius, 1 Target/Intensity | **Resist** : N/A |

One person or creature (to include oneself) per Intensity within the spell's Area of Effect receives double the normal Movement Rate and gains a +4 bonus to Initiative for the spell's Duration. In addition, the target may choose 2 Actions per Turn for each Action Point used. This does not increase the rate of spell casting or the Duration of a spell in any way. Therefore, a spellcaster under the effects of Haste will not cast spells any faster, nor benefit from the extra Action in the same Turn that spells are cast. Because of the subject's sped up metabolism, each casting of this spell will age the target 1% of their normal life expectancy, regardless of Duration. For humans, that would be about 1 year. See Aging on page XX for the average life expectancies of the demi-human races. The casting of Haste will cancel out the effects of Slow, and in this case, will not age the individual. Haste does not stack with itself or similar magical effects.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 3 Rounds; 1 target |
| 2 | 4 | 6 Rounds; 2 targets |
| 3 | 5 | 9 Rounds; 3 targets |
| 4 | 6 | 12 Rounds; 4 targets |
| Continue progression |

## Heal (Harm)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank** : Clr 4 | **Casting Time** : 1 Minute |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Healing | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3+1/Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Creature | **Resist** : N/A (Endurance or Evade) |

With the casting of Heal, the cleric can cure a physical malady, mental trauma, or a significant amount of injury with a single touch. The actual extent of this recovery is based on the Intensity of the spell as follows. For each level of Intensity, the spell heals the subject of one disease of any POT, cures any blindness or deafness, negates a mental disorder brought on by injury or magic, or heals a single Hit Location of up to 12 points of damage. It will not, however, restore a severed limb, as that requires a casting of the spell Regenerate. Each additional Intensity can be used to cure another malady or heal another Hit Location. It would therefore require a casting at Intensity 7 to heal an individual suffering burns to his entire body. Unlike lesser healing spells that limit their effectiveness against long-term injuries, there are no limits placed on the spell by the Duration in which the subject has suffered the effects of injury.

When reversed, Harm inflicts 12 points of magical injury to one of the victim's Hit Locations on a Failed roll to resist. Alternately, a malady is inflicted upon them, the effects of which are the same as the spell Cause Disease, the reverse of Cure Disease, but at +20 POT. The caster's Channel roll functions as the roll to hit their opponent and is assumed part of the spell's somatic requirement. No additional roll to hit is necessary. Neither worn nor natural armor offers any protection, but magical Armor Points reduce damage normally, and fully blocks inflicted maladies. Each additional Intensity affects another Hit Location contiguous to the first, with effects as determined by the initial Resistance roll. Neither version of this spell has any effect on the undead, creatures harmed only by iron, silver, or magical weapons, or non-corporeal beings.

## Hold Person

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank** : Clr 2, Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : XX | **Duration** : 2 Rounds/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3+1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 360 ft. |
| **Area** : 20 ft. Radius | **Resist** : Willpower |

This spell allows the caster to immobilize 1 humanoid creature per Intensity within the Area of Effect. A successful roll to resist completely negates the effects of the spell for that target only. Large humanoids (SIZ 21-40) are less susceptible to the Hold Person, with their Resistance roll being Easy, while the Resistance roll for Huge humanoids (SIZ 41+) is Very Easy. While held, affected creatures are completely helpless and nothing short of Dispel Magic will release them early.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 2 Rounds; 1 target |
| 2 | 4 | 4 Rounds; 2 targets |
| 3 | 5 | 6 Rounds; 3 targets |
| 4 | 6 | 8 Rounds; 4 targets |
| Continue progression |

## Holy Word (Unholy Word)

(Conjuration)

| **Rank** : Clr 5 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Combat | **Duration** : See Below |
| **Cost** : 3, +1 EXP | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : 30 ft. Radius | **Resist** : N/A |

When this spell is cast, the cleric utters a word of incredible divine power, capable of repelling evil entities from other planes of existence; however, the caster must be in their own plane to do so. The affected creatures are sent back to their plane of origin and cannot return to the caster's plane for at least 24 hours.

In addition, non-planar creatures of Evil Alignment suffer additional effects dependent upon the entity's Rank or SIZ, whichever gives the more beneficial result, as detailed on the following table.

| **Target Rank** | **Target SIZ** | **General** | **Skill\*\*** | **Movement** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0-1\* | 1-20 | Kills | - | - |
| 2 | 21-40 | Paralyzes 1d4 x10 Minutes | - | - |
| 3 | 41-60 | Slows 2d4 Rounds \*\*\* | Hard | 1/2 |
| 4-5 | 61+ | Deafens 1d4 Rounds | Formidable | 1/4 |

\* This category includes characters that do not possess a Class.

\*\* All skills, including combat, Resistance rolls, and spell casting.

\*\*\* As per the Rank 2 Arcane spell, See Classic Fantasy Imperative page XX.

Creatures that have been previously deafened or are otherwise unable to hear the spell are unaffected by the effects detailed in the table, however, other planar entities are still driven off as detailed above.

When reversed, Unholy Word functions as above, however only with regards to creatures of Good Alignment.

## Ice Storm

(Evocation)

| **Rank** : Mag 3 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : See Below |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 30 ft/Intensity |
| **Area** : See Below | **Resist** : See Below |

Ice Storm has two effects, one of which is chosen when the spell is cast:

Hail Stones (Duration: Instant): This variant of the spell causes large balls of hail to rain down in an area 60 feet in radius. Those caught in the area take 1d10 points of damage for each 2 points of Intensity, or fraction thereof. Each die of damage is rolled individually and applied to random Hit Locations. Fire-using creatures take +3 damage from each hail strike, and cold-using creatures' take half damage. Worn armor offers only half protection, but a creature's natural armor (or magical or magical Armor Points) reduce damage as normal. An Evade roll, throwing oneself prone, is only effective if within 5 feet of cover or of the edge of the Area of Effect. Otherwise, it is impossible to escape damage. Success in Evading allows the victim to suffer half the damage of each roll. Someone with the Artful Dodger Ability has the option to Evade without going prone, and if with 5 feet of cover or the edge of the Area of Effect, will take no damage on a successful roll, otherwise they take damage as normal.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 30 ft. Range; 1d10 dmg |
| 2 | 4 | 60 ft. Range; 1d10 dmg |
| 3 | 5 | 90 ft. Range; 2d10 dmg |
| 4 | 6 | 120 ft. Range; 2d10 dmg |
| 5 | 7 | 150 ft. Range; 3d10 dmg |
| Continue progression |

Driving Sleet (Duration: 1 Round/Intensity): This variant of the spell creates a driving sleet that whips through a path-like area 60 feet wide, and 120 feet long, blinding those affected. The actual path may be designated by the magic-user when the spell is cast. In addition, the ground in the affected area ices over, slowing the Movement Rate by 50%, and grounding fliers that Fail a Formidable Fly skill roll. Those on the ground must succeed at an Athletics roll every Round to resist falling prone, with the roll being two grades harder if moving faster than a walk. A character possessing Acrobatics may substitute that skill if desired. The ice will melt after the spell's Duration expires at a rate determined by the Games Master, dependent upon the ambient temperature; however, even in warm weather it will last a minimum of 10 minutes. Small fires, such as campfires and torches, are automatically extinguished. This spell will negate the effects of the spell Heat Metal.

## Identify

(Divination)

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Minute |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Protection | **Duration** : 1 Minute/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : Caster | **Resist** : NA |

With the casting of this spell the magic-user may attempt to identify the magical properties (if any) of one handled item or object. Simply touching the item is not typically enough, the item must be worn or held congruent with its design, e.g., a helm must be put on the head, an amulet slipped over the neck, a melee weapon firmly held if, a ring placed on a finger, and so forth. If the Arcane Casting roll is successful, a follow-up Arcane Knowledge roll will identify one magical property possessed by the item. One Arcane Knowledge attempt may be made each minute that the Duration continues. If a property requires an activation word, this is also identified along with the property. Items with charges will reveal the total currently available, along with the normal maximum, as will items possessing a Magic Point matrix.

Cursed items are typically activated when a piece of equipment is first put on or used; therefore, the casting of this spell will subject the magic-user to the effects of any curse if present. If the Arcane Casting skill test is successful, the magic-user is allowed a Willpower test to avoid the effects of any curse. This does not dispel the curse on the object, however, but it does allow the caster to remove the item without being affected.

A pearl of at least 100 GP value is ground into dust and consumed along with other mundane spell components to cast this spell. If a Luckstone is powdered and added to the infusion, the difficulty of the Arcane Casting roll is normal and all magical properties of any one item handled per minute throughout the spell's Duration are automatically learned, with no further rolls necessary.

## Ignite (Extinguish)

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Elemental (Fire) | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : 10 ft |
| **Area** : 1 Small Fire | **Resist** : NA |

This spell may be utilized in two separate ways, either to Ignite or Extinguish. The choice of which is made when cast.

Ignite only works on flammable inorganic matter, causing a small object or hand-sized area to burst into flame. Depending on what was set alight, once burning, the flames may then spread unless quenched or countered in some way. This spell is normally used to light candles, torches, or lanterns from afar. It can also be used to start a camp or cooking fire in adverse conditions, such as using damp kindling or in strong winds.

Extinguish immediately quenches flames and small fires of modest size and heat. It is useful for dousing candles, lanterns, torches, or small cook fires, but it will not work on magical or larger, more ferocious conflagrations such as pyres, burning houses, or dragon flames.

## Illusion

(Illusion)

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Concentration; See Below |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 100 ft/Intensity |
| **Area** : 50 ft. Radius/Intensity | **Resist** : Disbelieve |

This spell creates a visual illusion of anything the caster desires. It has no effect on other senses, making no sound, producing no odor, temperature, or texture, and so on.

This illusion may be of anything from an open meadow to an ancient red dragon, if it fits within the spell's Area of Effect. The illusion will last only so long as the caster maintains Concentration, or once it an opponent touches or enters it; doing so causes the magic sustaining it to unravel and the illusion to dissipate. However, the caster may maintain the illusion after physical contact, by expending 1 Magic Point and directing it to react appropriately to the contact so as not to create suspicion. For example, under normal circumstances, the illusion of an ogre would wink out of existence when struck by an arrow; however, the caster could have the ogre appear to shrug off the hit and charge the attacker by spending 1 Magic Point. It should be noted that the actual arrow is not stopped by the illusion and may still hit something or someone behind the manifestation.

While no actual damage may be done by the illusion, nor any temperature created, the mind can be convinced that it feels pain, suffering the effects of injury, or feeling extremes of heat or cold; however, objects will not appear to freeze or combust, unless the caster concentrates on these effects as well. Once the spell has been cast, additional visual effects may be added by the magic-user at will by concentrating on the desired effect. This typically takes no time and may be handled as a Free Action. So, for example, if the caster wished to have a dropped illusionary torch cause dry leaves to appear to catch fire, the caster could concentrate as a Free Action to do so.

See Illusions and Phantasms in Chapter 9 for more information.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 50 ft. radius; 100 ft. Range |
| 2 | 2 | 100 ft. radius; 200 ft. Range |
| 3 | 3 | 150 ft. radius; 300 ft. Range |
| 4 | 4 | 200 ft. radius; 400 ft. Range |
| Continue progression |

## Invisibility

(Illusion)

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 6 hours/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : NA |

When this spell is cast, the subject and any carried gear disappears, invisible to all forms of normal vision. This does not, however, render the individual undetectable by other means such as hearing, touch, smell, and so on, or by natural Abilities such as Life Sense or Sonar.

Those under the effects of Invisibility remain so throughout the spell's Duration (max. 24 hours), unless dispelled or the subject makes an attack, in which case the spell is nullified, and the individual reappears _after_ the attack. The target would be considered under the effects of Surprise (see page XX). No other actions negatively affect the Duration of the spell, allowing the subject to open doors, talk, climb, run, pick a pocket, and so forth. Even the casting of spells will not end the Duration unless they negatively affect one or more specific enemies in combat. Many of the previously mentioned actions could allow other means of detection, such as a possible Perception check to hear someone running past, or to feel a pocket being picked. The Games Master will assign penalties or bonuses to those attempting the detection according to how noticeable it is.

## Invisibility, 10 ft. Radius

(Illusion)

| **Rank** : Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 6 Hours/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : NA |

This spell functions identical to the Invisibility spell; however, all individuals within 10 feet of the recipient (which can be the caster themselves) when the spell is cast are rendered invisible as well. Those under the spell's effects can see each other; however, this does not grant the ability to see other invisible creatures. If any move out of the Area of Effect their Invisibility is lost, therefore, care must be taken to keep everyone within range of the original subject. Those moving back into the Area of Effect after their Invisibility has been lost, or having not been present when cast, do not benefit from its effects. Attacks made from the protection of Invisibility, including offensive spell casting by anyone other than the original subject, disrupt the Invisibility for that person but have no effect on other characters in the Area of Effect. However, an attack made by the original recipient of the spell renders everyone visible once again. See the basic Invisibility spell for further detail.

## Invisibility, Greater

(Illusion)

| **Rank** : Mag 3 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 3 Rounds/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : NA |

This spell functions as per the basic Invisibility spell; however, no action taken on the part of the subject will end the Duration early. The target may make melee or ranged attacks, cast spells, and so on. Note there are visible clues to the action having taken place, such as a visual distortion. This allows anyone with a line of sight on the subject to make a Formidable Perception roll after the action is taken, or possibly before if the character is delayed, to discern the location of the invisible attacker. An attack at one grade of difficulty may be made in the same Round the subject acted in by those who perceive the invisible person's location. See the spell Invisibility for further detail.

## Ironhand

(Abjuration)

| **Rank** : Clr 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Protection | **Duration** : 10 Minutes |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : None |

Ironhand allows the recipient to hold anything that would otherwise cause damage (such as extremely hot or cold items, or those dripping acid) without causing themselves injury. Thus, a user could grasp a brand from a fire, lift. a bubbling cauldron from a spit, or even reach through a steam vent to grab an object on the other side. It does not grant total immunity from damage, it merely stops from conducting through the skin of the recipient's hands. The spell does not protect anything worn on the hand, so rings, gloves, and such will suffer the effects of the source.

## Knock (Lock)

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : See Below |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 180 ft |
| **Area** : 1 Portal | **Resist** : NA |

This spell may be cast to open one door or other similar aperture of wood, stone, or metal if locked, stuck, Held, or Mage Locked. It has no effect on a portcullis or gate. The door may possess up to 25 Hit Points per Intensity, and can include locked chests or boxes, secret doors, and even shackles and chains. Even an aperture previously welded shut will break free of its bonds. A maximum of two different aspects may be affected by the casting of Knock, for example, a door that is barred, locked, and Held will require the casting of 2 Knock spells. Against Mage Locked doors, the Enchantment is simply suspended for 10 minutes after which it reverts to its magically locked state.

When reversed, Lock closes and locks one portal as noted above assuming there is a locking mechanism. Up to two different functions, lock, bolted, barred, and so forth, may be set.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | up to 25 HP portal; shackles, paddle locks, a typical wooden chest or door |
| 2 | 2 | up to 50 HP portal; a wooden reinforced chest or door |
| 3 | 3 | up to 75 HP portal; an iron chest or door |

## Know Alignment (Obscure Alignment)

(Divination)

| **Rank** : Clr 1, Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Divination | **Duration** : 1 Round/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 30 ft |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : Willpower |

This spell allows the caster to discern the Alignment and Passions of one creature, which gets a roll to resist. If the roll to resist Fails, the caster will divine the target's Ethical Code with respect to Law, Neutrality, and Chaos. Concentrating for a further Round is required to discern the target's moral Alignment with regards to Good, Neutrality, and Evil. Each additional Round beyond this will discern one other random remaining Passion. The Games Master reveals the 'strength' of the target's discovered Alignment and Passions according to the following table:

**Alignment/Passion Strength Table**

| **Percentage** | **Strength** |
| --- | --- |
| 01-29% | Weak |
| 30-69% | Average |
| 70-99% | Strong |
| 100% + | Very Strong |

The reverse of this spell, Obscure Alignment, makes a target's Alignment and Passions unreadable for 24 hours, even from the casting of Know Alignment or Detect Evil/Good.

## Know Languages (Confuse Languages)

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Minute |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 5 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Sapient Being | **Resist** : NA |

This spell allows the caster to understand and read almost any non-magical language. The 'speech' of non-sapient animals or creatures is not understood, only the true languages of sapient beings. The magic-user must touch the object or creature to comprehend its meaning. This spell gives no ability to speak or write the language.

The reverse of this spell, Confuse Languages_,_ makes a creature unintelligible to anyone or a piece of written text indecipherable. This reverse may also be used to counter Know Languages as it is being cast.

## Levitate

| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 10 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 60 ft/Intensity |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : Willpower |

When this spell is cast, the magic-user may designate themselves, one target, a creature, or an object, of no more than 20 SIZ (+10 SIZ per additional Intensity), and levitate that individual off the ground. A creature other than the caster may be moved vertically at a speed of 5 feet per Combat Round; if cast on oneself, the caster may move vertically up to 10 feet per Round. Levitation requires no Concentration on the part of the caster other than when changing elevation. If used on an unwilling subject, the target is allowed a roll to resist. While the subject of this spell is not granted any form of horizontal movement, the subject may be able to pull along a wall or cliff if within reach. The caster may end this spell when desired.

## Light (Darkness\*)

(Transmutation)

| **Sphere** : Sun | **Duration** : 1 Hour/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 180 ft |
| **Area** : 20 ft. Radius | **Resist** : See Below |

When this spell is cast, a globe of light materializes at a spot of the caster's choosing, which may be upon an object, or even in thin air, and may be dismissed by the caster at any time. The spell has a Duration of 1 hour per Intensity. If cast upon a creature, the target is allowed a Willpower test to resist, with a success indicating that the spell has affected the area directly behind the creature and not the creature itself. If Light is centered upon a creature's eyes, a Failed Willpower roll results in partial blindness with a Duration equal to that of the spell, increasing all skill and Resistance rolls requiring sight by one Difficulty Grade. The effects of the spell are immobile but can be cast on a portable or movable object.

\*The Divine version of this spell may be reversed, causing a sphere of utter and total darkness, which functions in all ways as the Arcane spell Darkness (see page XX) with the exception that it possesses a lesser Duration of 30 minutes per Intensity.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 20 ft. radius; 1 hour (30 min. reversed) |

## Lightning Bolt

(Evocation)

| **Rank** : Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 50 ft/Intensity |
| **Area** : 10 ft. wide path | **Resist** : Evade |

As the magic-user begins the verbal incantation and gestures on the first Turn of casting, an electrical charge begins arcing between their fingers. On the second Turn, the incantation complete, the magic-user sends a blast of lightning from the tip of a finger arcing in a straight line through all targets in a 10 ft. wide path running the Range of the spell. This damage causes 1d6 points of damage for each 2 points of Intensity, or fraction thereof, to all victims in the Area of Effect. This damage is rolled once, and applied to each of the target's Hit Locations, with both worn and natural armor offering no protection, but magical Armor Points reduce damage as normal.

A successful Evade roll, resulting in throwing oneself prone, allows the victim to suffer no damage. Someone with the Artful Dodger Ability has the option to Evade without going prone, but a Success in this case will only reduce damage by half, unless they are within 5 feet of the edge of the Area of Effect.

Lightning has a chance of igniting flammable materials equal to the damage rolled x1%. See 'Fires' in chapter 7 for additional information. Lightning may also shatter or destroy inanimate objects from sheer impact.

## Locate Object (Obscure Object)

(Divination)

| **Rank** : Clr2, Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |

| **Sphere** : Divination | **Duration** : 1 Minute/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : 60 ft/Intensity | **Resist** : NA |

With the casting of Locate Object, the caster is directed to a known or familiar item, sensing the direction to the object as the caster stands and slowly turns. The object must be within the spell's area of affect, however. The object may be any generic item such as a bed, chest, stairwell, or gold for example, and the spell will direct the caster towards the nearest representation of that object. Specific items on the other hand, such as Tashana's long sword, requires that the caster have an accurate mental image, having either seen it in person within 30 feet, or through magical means. Therefore, a personal or unique item may not be located using this spell unless the caster is familiar with it. The spell cannot locate living or non-living creatures.

The reverse of this spell, Obscure Object, conceals one item from detection by magical means, such as crystal balls, Detect Magic, and so on, for the same Duration.

## Mage Lock

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Portal | **Resist** : NA |

This spell may be cast on any lockable object such as a chest, door, portal, or even a lockable tome. The object, which may be up to 25 Hit Points per Intensity, is permanently sealed unless battered open. Dispel Magic cast at an Intensity greater than the spell's Magnitude will only render it open for one Round, and Knock may be used to temporarily open a Mage Locked door for 10 minutes, after which the original spell continues. Finally, a magic-user of a higher Rank than the original caster may freely pass through a Mage Locked door without breaking the Enchantment, and they may even hold the portal for others. Unlike Secure Portal, Mage Locked objects are not automatically disrupted by creatures from beyond the prime material plane such as demons, devils, angels, and elementals, or those using material passing spells.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | up to 25 HP portal; shackles, paddle locks, a typical wooden chest or door |
| 2 | 4 | up to 50 HP portal; a wooden reinforced chest or door |
| 3 | 5 | up to 75 HP portal; an iron chest, door, or portcullis |
| 4 | 6 | up to 120 HP portal; a small castle gate |
| 5 | 7 | up to 150 HP portal; a large, reinforced castle gate |

## Magic Missile

(Evocation)

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 100 ft/Intensity |
| **Area** : 1-5 Targets | **Resist** : See Below |

When this spell is cast, one or more missiles of magical energy dart forth from the magic-user's fingertips and strike a target. The maximum number of missiles that may be generated is based on the caster's Arcane Casting skill level, with a second missile being generated at 60% skill, a third at 70%, fourth at 80%, and a fifth and final missile at 90%. To generate these missiles, the spell must be cast at an Intensity equal to the number of missiles desired. For example, at below 60%, a magic-user that casts Magic Missile at 3 Intensity would achieve the longer Range, however only a single missile will be generated. A magic-user of skill level 70% could cast the spell at the same 3 Intensity and attain the same Range but able to generate 3 missiles. This spell has a Maximum Intensity of 5. See the table below.

A Magic Missile will strike unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat or has partial cover. These missiles may not be evaded; however, an opponent in total cover cannot be targeted with this spell. The Shield spell will automatically deflect Magic Missiles assuming the target is aware and/or facing the caster. Magic Missiles do 1d6+1 points of damage and worn armor does not protect, but a creature's natural armor or magical Armor Points reduce damage as normal. Magic Missiles cause no damage to inanimate objects such as doors, locks, and so forth.

When shooting multiple missiles, the caster may have them strike a single creature, or target several creatures. Each Magic Missile will strike a random Hit Location; specific Hit Locations may not be targeted. The caster must designate individual targets of each missile before they roll for damage.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 100 ft. Range; 1 missile |
| 2 | 2 | 200 ft. Range; 2 missiles if 60% skill |
| 3 | 3 | 300 ft. Range; 3 missiles if 70% skill |
| 4 | 4 | 400 ft. Range; 4 missiles if 80% skill |
| 5 max. | 5 | 500 ft. Range; 5 missiles if 90% skill |

## Magic Mouth

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 1 Minute |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : See Below |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 30 ft |
| **Area** : 1 Object | **Resist** : NA |

This spell creates a mouth on an item or object, which magically appears when triggered by a specific event or time appointed by the magic-user when the spell is first cast. This mouth will then speak whatever predefined phrase the caster chose at the time of the casting. This phrase must consist of no more than 25 words and are spoken by the mouth at a rate of roughly 1 word per second. The mouth may not speak words of power or cast spells.

This spell may be cast upon any normally inanimate object, from a pillar or tree, to a stone wall or a chest; however, it is particularly effective when cast on a statue, as the statue itself would look as if speaking. It cannot be cast on any living creature with any form of Intelligence or Instinct. This applies to those that were formerly alive. When casting this spell, the magic-user determines the situation that will activate the enchantment. It can be designed to trigger via anything from a spoken word to the creation of any noise. It could be as general as 'when the next person enters this room…' to as specific as, 'when a female Cleric of Sedona comes within 10 feet of the statue at the end of the hall on a Saturday…'. The triggering effect cannot be something that cannot be discerned non-magically, such as an invisible creature, a creature's Alignment, skill, Class, etc. However, it could designate clothing worn. The maximum distance that the spell can be triggered is 25 feet per Intensity.

This spell's Duration is permanent until the enchantment is activated and then the spell ends.

## Magic Tricks

(Conjuration)

| **Rank** : Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Concentration |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : 30 ft. Radius | **Resist** : None |

Magic Tricks are a great form of entertainment among the common folk, downtrodden, and most especially children. Some effects commonly created with Magic Tricks include puffs of wind to flicker candles, pulling a silver piece from behind a child's ear, causing a flower to quickly bloom, performing card tricks, creating eerie ethereal music that issues from nowhere, and so forth. Magic Tricks are unable to cause even a single point of damage or any amount of distraction in combat but could be used to keep a crowd occupied while the rest of the party sneaks past.

## Meteor Shower

(Evocation)

| **Rank** : Mag 5 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Instantaneous |
| **Cost** : 3/Intensity | **Range** : 20 ft/Intensity |
| **Area** : See Below | **Resist** : Evade |

When the magic-user casts this spell, two micro-meteors per level of Intensity streak from the outstretched hand. The meteors arc toward their target, impacting on a downward trajectory, leaving a trail of sparks and cinders in their wake. Upon impact, they detonate in multiple fiery explosions around the target point. The first meteor always strikes the targeted location, while any additional meteors strike randomly around it, each with an explosive radius of 30 feet. To determine where they hit, roll 1d8 for the direction.

Each meteor does 1d10 points of fire damage to those in the Area of Effect. However, due to the radius of each explosion, many will overlap, doing additional damage to those unfortunate enough to get caught by them. The damage rolls are combined and applied to each of the target's Hit Locations, with worn armor offering no protection, but magical Armor Points or a creature's natural armor reduce damage as normal.

A successful Evade roll allows the victim to suffer no damage. Someone with the Artful Dodger Ability has the option to Evade without going prone, but a success in this case will only reduce damage by half, unless they are within 5 feet of the edge of the Area of Effect.

Everyone, including those outside the Area of Effect but within 60 feet of an impact point, are required to succeed at an Athletics roll to remain standing.

Meteor Shower has a chance of igniting flammable materials equal to the damage rolled x5%. See 'Fires' on page XX for additional information.

| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Combat | **Duration** : Trigger |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : None |

Might allows the recipient to engage in an impressive act of physical brute force, by adding the caster's POW to the recipient's Brawn skill. It does not increase the character's Damage Modifier when inflicting combat damage.

## Mirror Image

(Illusion)

| **Rank** : Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 3 Rounds/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : 5 ft. Radius | **Resist** : NA |

When this spell is cast, 2d4 duplicates of the magic-user appear within a 5 ft. radius, exactly mimicking the caster's movements. In addition, the entire Area of Effect wavers and shimmers, making the caster's exact location impossible to ascertain. Striking one of the illusionary images causes it to vanish; however, the remaining images are unaffected. Striking the caster has no effect on the remaining images and as the images are always shifting, there is no way of knowing if the target is the real caster if attacked again. Any injuries suffered by the caster are duplicated on the images as well. There are numerous ways the Games Master can determine if the actual caster has been struck or one of the images. One is to determine how many potential targets are available, including the caster, and roll a die of the closest denomination. For example, with 4 images and the caster, the attacker should roll 1d6, re-rolling a result of 6, with the caster being hit on a roll of 1. Another would be to have several markers equal to the number of potential targets, marking one as being the caster. A marker is drawn each time an attack is made and if the target is hit, damage is applied; otherwise, an image disappears, removing one of the markers. The images vanish at the end of the spell's Duration.

## Neutralize Poison (Inflict Poison)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank** : Clr 3 | **Casting Time** : 1 Round |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Healing | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : NA (Endurance) |

This spell allows the caster to cancel the effect of poison or venom afflicting a creature and may be used to cure an individual that has 'died' of poisoning if used within 10 minutes of death. One level of Intensity is required per 30 Potency of the inflicting poison. Neutralize Poison may also be used to nullify the venom produced by a poisonous creature such as a snake or scorpion so that it will not be capable of poisoning others: this requires 1 Intensity per 30 Potency and when used in this way, has a Duration of 24 hours. Finally, Neutralize Poison may be used on poisoned or otherwise tainted substances, treating 5 lbs. of solids or 2 gallons) of liquids per Intensity.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | Cure victim of POT 1-30 poison; nullify a poisonous creature of POT 1-30; treat up to 5 lbs. of poisoned solids, or 2 gallons of liquid |
| 2 | 4 | Cure victim of POT 31-60 poison; nullify a poisonous creature of POT 31-60; treat up to 10 lbs. of poisoned solids, or 4 gallons of liquid |
| 3 | 5 | Cure victim of POT 61-90 poison; nullify a poisonous creature of POT 61-90; treat up to 15 lbs. of poisoned solids, or 6 gallons of liquid |
| 4 | 6 | Cure victim of POT 91-120 poison; nullify a poisonous creature of POT 91-120; treat up to 20 lbs. of poisoned solids, or 8 gallons of liquid |
| Continue progression |

When reversed, Inflict Poison allows the caster to produce a deadly toxin in a victim. This venom is detailed below.

Application: Contact

Potency: equal to Intensity x30

Resistance: Endurance

Onset Time: 1d2+1 Rounds

Duration: 1d3x10 Minutes

Conditions: Victims begin with Agony lasting 2 Rounds before Asphyxiation strikes, usually resulting in death, unless magically treated with either Slow or Neutralize Poison.

Antidote/Cure: None short of magical treatment.

## Part Water

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Clr 4 | **Casting Time** : 10 Minutes |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Elemental (Water) | **Duration** : 10 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 60 ft/Intensity |
| **Area** : See Below | **Resist** : NA |

This spell allows the caster to part water or other forms of liquid, creating a safe path which may then be traversed if desired. The spell creates a trough 100 feet wide, with a depth of 10 feet per Intensity, and a length of 120 feet per Intensity. Therefore, if cast at an Intensity of 4, the parting would be 70 feet deep, 480 feet long, with a width of 100 feet. The spell can be ended early by the caster, otherwise it continues until its Duration expires. This spell can be cast underwater, which instead creates a "corridor" of air with the same dimensions noted above. Finally, Part Water may be cast offensively on a creature such as a water elemental, and if so, causes 10 points of damage for every level of Intensity. Assuming the entity survives, it must succeed at a Willpower Resistance roll or flee the caster for 3d4 minutes.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 10 min.; 60 ft. Range; 100 ft. wide; 10 ft. deep; 120 ft. long |

## Permanency

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 4 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3, +2 EXP | **Range** : See Below |
| **Area** : See Below | **Resist** : NA |

The casting of this spell changes the Duration of certain other spells to Permanent. To use this spell, the magic-user will first cast the spell to be made permanent. However, upon finishing the casting of that spell it is held back, and an additional Action Point is spent casting Permanency, after which the selected spell is cast in its permanent form. Each spell made permanent costs the caster 2 Experience Roll as well as the noted 3 Magic Points, in addition to the normal Casting Cost of the original spell. Having Dispel Magic cast during the casting of Permanency not only dispels Permanency, but the original spell as well.

Permanency is also a key application in the creation of magic items using the spell Enchant Item. In addition to the spells noted below, other spells may be made permanent with the permission of the Games Master.

The following personal spells, those which only affect the caster, will benefit from this spell. They may not be made permanent on other creatures:

| Avert | Might |
| --- | --- |
| Coordination | Protection (Self) |
| Darkvision | Preserve |
| Deflect | Know Languages |
| Detect Evil | Protection from Evil |
| Detect Invisibility | Read Magic |
| Detect Magic | Tongues |
| Glamour |
 |

The Permanency spell may also be used to make the following spells, which are cast on other creatures, objects, or areas, permanent. Spells marked with as asterisk may only be made permanent on an object or area.

| Chill \* | Preserve |
| --- | --- |
| Cleanse | Tidy \* |
| Dancing Lights\* | Magic Mouth \* |
| Fear | Wall of Fire\* |
| Invisibility | Web \* |
| Polish \* |

## Pet

| **Rank** : Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Animal | **Duration** : Concentration |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Animal | **Resist** : Willpower |

Pet allows the caster to take mental control of a small creature, sending it off to scout, fetch, or perform some other complex task. It can be cast on any creature neither of whose SIZ and INS Characteristics may exceed half the caster's CHA. If the targeted creature is already the loyal pet of the caster, it does not need to resist the spell. While concentrating, the caster may access the animal's senses (sight, smell, hearing, and so on)

## Plane Shift

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Clr 3 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Astral | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : See Below | **Resist** : Willpower |

When cast, the cleric and up to 7 others (one per additional level of Intensity) can travel to another plane of existence. Everyone must be touching and forming a circle while the cleric casts the spell. In addition, the caster may also use the spell to transport one creature independent of themselves, willing or otherwise, to a plane of the caster's choice; however, the unwilling can make a Willpower roll to resist, with a Success negating the spell. The precise point of arrival is seldom what the caster desires. If using a hex map, roll 1d6 to determine the direction and 1d10x10 for the distance in miles.

In addition to any generic material components, the casting of Plane Shift requires rods of various rare metals, each specially attuned to a plane of existence. These rods are rare and easily valued at as much as 10,000 GP each.

## Polish

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Clr 0, Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Creation | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : None |

Polish instantly buffs one object equal in 'Things' or SIZ of up to the caster's POW to a high sheen making it glossy, shiny, and highly desirable, even if the quality of the article is sub-par. The item will lose its sheen normally overtime.

## Polymorph Other

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 3 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity (+1 EXP) | **Range** : 15 ft/Intensity |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : Willpower |

The caster can alter the form of one corporeal targeted creature into that of another, with each point of Intensity altering SIZ by up to 5 points. Therefore, transforming an orc of SIZ 16 into a SIZ 1 rabbit would require 3 levels of Intensity (15 SIZ points of difference). The subject of this spell is allowed a Willpower roll to resist. Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) are less susceptible to being polymorphed, with their Resistance roll being Easy, while the Resistance roll for Huge creatures (SIZ 41+) is Very Easy.

The entire transformation process takes a full Round and can be quite stressful to the creature in question, requiring a second Willpower roll to retain their original personality, with a Failure stunning the subject for 1d10 minutes, and a Fumble resulting in death from mental shock. Each doubling or halving of the creature's original SIZ makes the Willpower roll to retain the personality one grade more difficult, as would a complete change of environment, such as changing a person into a fish. A successful roll allows the victim to retain their INT and CHA as well as any skills requiring those Characteristics.

The transformation grants the recipient the assumed creature's form of breathing, if other than normal; any natural attacks; and all mundane modes of movement. It does not grant any heightened or magical Abilities possessed by the creature. For example, a creature that has been polymorphed into a dragon will not gain the creature's breath attack or spell-like abilities, but will gain the ability to fly, it's tough hide, deadly bite, claw attacks, and so on. In addition, the victim gains the new form's physical skills such as Athletics, Brawn, Fly, Swim, as well as its Hit Points and Damage Modifier. Assuming the transformed individual retained their INT, they still lose the capacity to speak, unless the new form possesses the ability to articulate words. Those that were able to cast spells in their previous form would still be able to cast in the new form, assuming they still possess the capability to produce the verbal and somatic components. In the case of a drastic change, such as being changed from biped to quadruped, or a land animal to a sea creature, for example, the Games Master should feel free to penalize by at least one Difficulty Grade, the use of any skills that would take time to learn while adjusting to the new form until there has been sufficient time to practice. This is especially true of physical skills such as Athletics, Unarmed, Swim, Fly, Combat Skills, and so on.

The Willpower roll to retain one's personality is required every day that the subject remains transformed until failed, causing the person to finally succumb to the mentality of the new form, with INT changing to INS in the case of a non-sapient creature. All special and magical Abilities owned by the new form that were not acquired previously, such as gaze attacks, breath weapons, and so on, are now available to the creature as the transformation is complete. Characters that lose their identity in this way become Non-Player Characters under the control of the Games Master.

Prior to succumbing mentally to the transformation, the polymorphed creature is susceptible to Dispel Magic as normal, with no roll to resist required, as it would be one's subconscious desire to return to normal. The transformation does require another Willpower roll to resist the strain, with a Failure stunning the subject for 1d10 minutes, and a Fumble resulting in death from mental shock.

If the victim had previously succumbed to the new form, Dispel Magic may still be used; however, the victim will attempt to resist returning to the natural form with a Willpower roll. Failing this roll means the victim transforms back into the natural form, which, of course, requires another Willpower roll to resist the mental shock from the transformation. Once lost, a victim's natural identity is no longer attainable, instead the victim assumes the strange and alien form is not natural and yearns to be returned to its prior 'normal.' _For example, an orc that was polymorphed into a rabbit and assumed the creature's identity would believe that it is now a rabbit that has been rather rudely transformed into an orc._ Only a Wish, or other similar magic, has any chance of restoring the victim's identity once it has been lost.

All worn and carried equipment magically melds into the new form; however, in some cases, the Games Master may allow magic items that would still be able to be used in the creature's new form to remain, such as a magic ring or boots. Note this requires the creature's new SIZ to not be vastly different from the original. There is a POW x1% chance for each worn magic item of a defensive or miscellaneous nature, subject to Games Master approval, to transfer its effects to the creature's new form. A creature with a +1 ring of protection for example, could gain a +1 bonus to its natural Armor Points. Creatures with the natural capability to shape change, such as doppelgängers and lycanthropes, will be transformed as normal, but may assume their normal form after 1 Round. If slain, a polymorphed creature reverts to its natural form, even if it has previously lost all traces of identity.

## Polymorph Self

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 3 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 20 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : Caster | **Resist** : NA |

The caster can assume the form of any other corporeal creature, from as small as SIZ 1 up to SIZ 40. Each point of Intensity allows an increase or decrease of up to 10 points of SIZ. Therefore, a magic-user of SIZ 13 could assume the shape of a SIZ 34 grizzly bear at 3 levels of Intensity. The transformation process takes a full Round and grants the caster the assumed creature's form of breathing (if other than that of itself, for example, breathing water), any natural attacks, Hit Points, Damage Modifier, and its normal mode of movement. It does not grant any heightened or magical Abilities possessed by the creature. A magic-user that has polymorphed into a hawk, for example, will not gain the bird's extraordinary eyesight. The caster gains the creature's physical skills such as Athletics, Brawn, Fly, Swim, and so forth, but retains any mental and social skills (those requiring INT and CHA). The caster loses the capacity to speak unless the creature in question possesses the ability to articulate words. If so, the caster can still cast spells in the new form assuming the caster can form a spell's somatic components.

The caster may end the effect at any time, and in the process, all Minor Wounds gained while in the new form are lost, and Serious Wounds are reduced to Minor Wounds (half Hit Points lost in each applicable location). Major Wounds are not affected by the transformation and carry over to the natural form. There is no healing when the caster transforms from natural to animal form.

Polymorph is subject to Dispel Magic. In this case, the caster does not benefit from the healing. If slain, the caster will revert to the natural form. If transformed into a flier and required to make a Fly skill roll, Athletics or Acrobatics may be substituted at two grades of difficulty. However, a character that uses this form frequently may choose to develop the Fly skill normally at a Base Value of STR+DEX.

| **Intensity** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 20 min.; 1-10 SIZ points of difference |
| 2 | 4 | 40 min.; 11-20 SIZ points of difference |
| 3 | 5 | 60 min.; 21-30 SIZ points of difference |
| 4 | 6 | 80 min.; 31-40 SIZ points of difference |

## Prayer

(Conjuration)

| **Rank** : Clr 3 | **Casting Time** : 1 Minute |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Combat | **Duration** : 10 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : 60 ft. Radius | **Resist** : NA |

When cast, this spell blesses the cleric and all allies within the Area of Effect, while cursing those in opposition. Allies are granted a temporary +5% bonus to all skill and Resistance rolls along with a +1 bonus to all damage dealt, while enemies receive a -5% penalty and -1 damage reduction. This spell may be cast along with Chant if cast by either the same cleric, or another cleric of the same religion, allowing both effects to stack, granting a +10% bonus to skills and +2 to damage, while enemies receive the opposite.

## Predict Weather

(Divination)

| **Rank** : Clr1, Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Minute |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Weather | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : 5 mi. Radius | **Resist** : NA |

This spell allows the caster to predict the weather with 100% certainty within a 5-mile radius. This forecast is for the next 4 hours per level of Intensity and includes temperature, precipitation, snow accumulation, wind speed, and so forth.

## Preserve

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Clr0, Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Turn |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Animal, Plant | **Duration** : 1d3 Months |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : See Below | **Resist** : NA |

Preserve prevents organic matter, both vegetable and animal, from bacterial decay and putrefaction for 1d3 months, by sterilizing it. If the material is later smoked, pickled, or salted it is preserved indefinitely. The spell can halt decay that has begun, but not reverse it. The caster can affect an amount of organic matter equal in 'Things' or SIZ to their POW.

## Power Word - Blind

(Conjuration)

| **Rank** : Mag 4 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : See Below |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 20 ft/Intensity |
| **Area** : 15 ft. Radius | **Resist** : Endurance |

Upon successfully casting this spell, one creature of the caster's choice within both line of sight and Range, is struck blind, along with all others in a 15 ft. radius that Fail a Resistance roll. This blindness may be cured by the casting of Cure Blindness or Dispel Magic. The spell's Duration is modified by the target's Rank or SIZ, whichever gives the more beneficial result. This is detailed in the following table.

| **Target Rank** | **Target SIZ** | **Duration** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0-1\* | 1-20 | 1d4+1 x10 minutes\*\* |
| 2 | 21-40 | 1d4+1 minutes |
| 3 | 41-60 | 1d4+1 Rounds |
| 4 | 61-80 | 1d3 Rounds |
| 5 | 81+ | 1 Round |

\* This category includes characters that do not possess a Class.

\*\* If only one to three creatures are in the Area of Effect, the effects are permanent until magically treated.

## Power Word - Kill

(Conjuration)

| **Rank** : Mag 5 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3/Intensity, +3 EXP | **Range** : 20 ft/Intensity |
| **Area** : 10 ft. Radius | **Resist** : Endurance |

The successful casting of this spell will kill either a single creature of up to Rank 3 or SIZ 60 (or 4 creatures per Intensity of no greater then SIZ 20), that Fail a Resistance roll. This spell is extremely draining on the caster, with each casting causing the automatic loss of one level of Fatigue. All potential targets must lie within the Area of Effect, as designated when the spell is cast. The Intensity required is dependent upon the target's Rank or SIZ, whichever gives the target the more beneficial result, as detailed on the following table.

| **Target Rank** | **Target SIZ** | **Intensity** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0-1\* | 1-20 | 1 Intensity +3 EXP to Kill |
| 2 | 21-40 | 2 Intensity +3 EXP to Kill |
| 3 | 41-60 | 3 Intensity +3 EXP to Kill |
| 4-5 | 61+ | No effect |

\* This category includes characters that do not possess a Class.

Creatures larger than SIZ 60 are unaffected, as are characters of Rank 4 and up. Unlike the Death Spell, Power Word - Kill will kill anything within the above-mentioned limits, however, it is possible to bring victims back to life through the casting of Wish, Raise Dead, Resurrection, and Reincarnation as normal.

## Power Word – Stun

(Conjuration)

| **Rank** : Mag 3 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : See Below |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 20 ft/Intensity |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : Endurance |

Upon successfully casting this spell, one creature of the caster's choice within both line of sight and Range, which Fails a Resistance roll is stunned. The victim is rendered briefly insensible, only allowed Reactive Actions of a defensive nature. The Duration is modified by the target's Rank or SIZ, whichever gives the more beneficial result for the target. This is detailed on the following table. This stunning may be cured before the Duration expires through the casting of Dispel Magic.

| **Target Rank** | **Target SIZ** | **Duration** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0-1\* | 1-20 | 4d4 Rounds |
| 2 | 21-40 | 2d4 Rounds |
| 3 | 41-60 | 1d4 Rounds |
| 4 | 61-80 | 1 Round |
| 5 | 81+ | Unaffected |

\* This category includes characters that do not possess a Class.

## Protection

(Abjuration)

| **Rank** : Clr 0, Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Protection | **Duration** : Trigger |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : NA |

Protection is useful in a wide range of tasks where there is a risk of accidental injury such as working in a foundry or mine. The first time the character would normally take damage that penetrates protective clothing or armor, the Protection spell will trigger, and reduce the damage taken by 1d3 points. The spell then dissipates. This spell stacks with all other forms of protection magic. The spell only protects against physical damage so will not help against events such as fire, choking, and so on. The mage version of this spell may be cast on themselves only.

## Protection from Cold

(Abjuration)

| **Rank** : Clr 2 | **Casting Time** : 1 Round |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Protection, Elemental (Fire) | **Duration** : 15 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : NA |

When this spell is cast, an invisible field forms that offers complete protection from all forms of natural cold. When cast on oneself, the field also offers complete protection from cold-based damage (white dragon breath, cone of cold, chill metal, and so on), absorbing 12 points of cold damage per Intensity. Once this field is depleted, any excess damage remaining from that attack is halved before being applied.

When cast on someone other than oneself, complete protection from natural cold is also granted. In addition, damage from magical cold attacks is reduced by half.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 15 min.; 12 points of cold protection on self |
| 2 | 4 | 30 min.; 24 points of cold protection on self |
| 3 | 5 | 45 min.; 36 points of cold protection on self |
| 4 | 6 | 60 min.; 42 points of cold protection on self |
| Continue progression |

## Protection from Evil (Protection from Good)

(Abjuration)

| **Rank** : Clr1, Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Protection | **Duration** : 2 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : NA |

When cast, an invisible aura of magical armor radiates from the recipient of the spell (which can be the caster), granting three different levels of defense.

First, attacks by creatures with an Evil Alignment receive a -10% penalty to their Combat Style or Unarmed skill. Resistance rolls on the part of the recipient of Protection from Evil receive a +10% bonus, but only against evil creatures.

Second, neither summoned nor conjured creatures, nor beings not native to the material plane, may make physical contact with the recipient. This includes demons, devils, genies, elementals, aerial servants, salamanders, and so on. Natural attacks by these creatures cause them to recoil, thus failing to make contact. This also includes any monsters or creatures conjured or summoned by spells or items. Weapons held by such creatures may still enter the magical barrier and strike the protected individual, however.

Third, any attempts of mental control (such as by spells like Charm or Command) or possession (such as by spells like Magic Jar), automatically Fail to penetrate the magical protection.

The spell's Duration ends if the protected individual makes any type of melee attack or attempts to impose the protective field against an affected creature.

The reverse of this spell, Protection from Good, works as above with regards to the second and third benefit, while the first benefit functions as noted with regards to good opponents.

## Protection from Fire

(Abjuration)

| **Rank** : Clr 2 | **Casting Time** : 1 Round |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Protection, Elemental (Fire) | **Duration** : 15 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : NA |

When this spell is cast, an invisible field forms that offers complete protection from all forms of mundane sources of heat, such as torches, campfires, burning buildings, and so forth. When cast on oneself, the field also offers complete protection from fire-based damage (red dragon breath, Burning Hands, Heat Metal, and so on), absorbing 12 points of fire damage per Intensity. Once this field is depleted, any excess damage remaining from that attack is halved before being applied.

When cast on someone other than oneself, complete protection from mundane fire is also granted. In addition, damage from magical fire attacks is reduced by half.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 15 min.; 12 points of fire protection on self |
| 2 | 4 | 30 min.; 24 points of fire protection on self |
| 3 | 5 | 45 min.; 36 points of fire protection on self |
| 4 | 6 | 60 min.; 42 points of fire protection on self |
| Continue progression |

## Protection from Lightning

(Abjuration)

| **Rank** : Clr 3 | **Casting Time** : 1 Round |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Protection, Weather | **Duration** : 15 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : NA |

When this spell is cast, an invisible field forms that offers complete protection from electrical based damage (blue dragon breath, shocking grasp, electrical traps, and so on), absorbing 12 points of electrical damage per Intensity. Once this field is depleted, any excess damage remaining from that attack is halved before being applied.

When cast on someone other than oneself, damage from electrical attacks is reduced by half.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 15 min.; 12 points of electrical protection on self |
| 2 | 4 | 30 min.; 24 points of electrical protection on self |
| 3 | 5 | 45 min.; 36 points of electrical protection on self |
| 4 | 6 | 60 min.; 42 points of electrical protection on self |
| Continue progression |

## Purify Food and Drink (Contaminate Food and Drink)

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Clr 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Minute |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : All | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 100 ft. |
| **Area** : 5 ft. Radius | **Resist** : NA |

When this spell is cast, all poison, rot, and other contaminants are removed from an average sized meal of food and/or water per Intensity within the spell's Area of Effect. The purifying properties of this spell also destroy the malignant properties of unholy water.

The reverse of the spell, Contaminate Food and Drink, spoils food, makes pure water undrinkable, and corrupts the sacred properties of holy water.

## Raise Dead (Slay Living)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank** : Clr 3 | **Casting Time** : 1 Minute |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Necromantic | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity, +1 EXP | **Range** : 100 ft. |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : NA (Willpower) |

This spell may be cast on the corpse of a creature dead less than 24 hours per level of Intensity. If the subject's Alignment was anything other than evil, they can resist the spell with an Opposed Willpower roll and, if successful, negate the effects of the spell. This is because the soul or spirit of the deceased is rarely willing to return to the living once it has reached its eternal reward. The Games Master can decide to waive the roll if the recipient has unfinished business, cannot be separated from their true love, or has some other heroic reason to live.

In the case of evil souls, who would gladly return to the material plane instead of suffering eternal damnation, it is not the deceased's Willpower that is resisting, but that of the demon, devil, and so on, placed in charge of their punishment, their tormentor. In this case, the caster must overcome the tormentor's Willpower. If this is unknown, assume it is at least 20 points higher than that of the deceased to represent that the stronger the soul's will, as a more powerful being was placed in charge of their damnation. If the caster succeeds, they have successfully returned the spirit to the body, while a Failed roll results in the victim being either unwilling or unable to return.

If the casting is successful, the subject is returned to life with full Hit Points, although severed limbs remain lost. This means that a victim decapitated or cut in half cannot be raised until their head or torso is first reattached. This can be done before the casting of Raise Dead by physically reattaching the severed location, which requires a healer's kit and a successful application of the Healing skill, and typically leaves an obvious and telling scar. Other maladies, such as poison or disease must be taken care of prior to, or after the casting of Raise Dead, or the results are only temporary. Finally, Raise Dead has no effect on a creature that has reached the end of its natural life span, and died of old age.

The act of being raised from the dead is very straining on the subject, who is reduced to a Fatigue Level of Incapacitated for a period of 24 hours for each day they were dead. The casting of Cure Fatigue has no effect on the patient during this time of convalescence. After this point, the character recovers from Fatigue normally, and without restriction.

When reversed, Slay Living, can be used to kill one victim designated by the cleric at the time of the casting. This victim is allowed a Willpower roll to resist, modified by the target's Rank or SIZ, whichever gives the more beneficial result to the target, as detailed on the following table.

| **Target Rank** | **Target SIZ** | **Willpower Modifier** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0-1\* | 1-20 | Hard |
| 2 | 21-40 | Standard |
| 3 | 41-60 | Easy |
| 4-5 | 61+ | Very Easy |

\* This category includes characters that do not possess a Class.

If the Resistance roll is unsuccessful, the victim is slain outright. A successful roll is treated as per the effects of Cause Serious Wounds. Armor offers no protection from this damage.

## Read Magic

(All)

| **Rank** : Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Minute |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 2 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : Caster | **Resist** : NA |

This spell is the first spell taught to apprentice magic-users, for it is through this spell that they can read the magical writings of another spellcaster. Mages' own magical writings are always intelligible to themselves. Reading magical script does not typically activate a contained spell such as that found on magical scrolls, for example; however, cursed magic scrolls and the like are activated using this spell, casting whatever spell the scroll contained.

When used to identify a spell contained on a scroll or within a spell book, 1 minute is required for each spell Rank; Rank 1 spells take 1 minute, Rank 2 spells take 2 minutes, and so forth. If sufficient Duration remains, additional spells may be identified during this time. Once this spell has been used to read and identify a set of magical inscriptions, the magic-user does not need to cast Read Magic to read them again; however, the same spell on a separate scroll, book, and so on, would need another casting of Read Magic.

Read Magic is usable by all Schools of Magic.

## Regenerate (Wither)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank** : Clr 4 | **Casting Time** : 3 Minutes |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Healing | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3/Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Creature | **Resist** : NA (Parry or Evade) |

When cast, the cleric may touch one creature and regenerate a dismembered Hit Location. Lost limbs will completely grow back at a rate of 1 Hit Point every 10 minutes until fully healed. However, if the severed location is present and touching the victim, the entire recovery time is reduced to 1 minute. This spell cannot be used to 'clone' an individual by regenerating two separate parts, with only the portion connected to the brain and central nervous system benefiting from the effects of the spell. Each level of Intensity will regrow a separate Hit Location. While the spell could be used to slowly heal a lesser injury, there are lower Rank, less costly spells to do so.

When reversed, Wither will cause a location touched by the caster to shrivel up and eventually fall off the victim. The process causes the loss of 1 Hit Point of damage to the impacted location per 10 minutes, with the location becoming unusable at 0 Hit Points, and falling off when fully negative. The effects may only be negated by a casting of Regenerate.

## Reincarnation, Arcane

(Necromancy)

| **Rank** : Mag 4 | **Casting Time** : 10 Minutes |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity, +1EXP | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : See Below |

This spell is cast while touching the corpse of a creature dead less than 24 hours per level of Intensity. However, this version of Reincarnation has no effect on full-blooded elves (instead, see Divine Reincarnation). If the victim's Alignment was anything other than evil, the victim resists the spell with an Opposed Willpower roll, and if successful, negates the effects of the spell. This is because the soul or spirit of the deceased is rarely willing to enter a new body once it has reached its eternal reward. The Games Master can decide to waive the roll if the recipient has unfinished business, cannot be separated from their true love, or has some other heroic reason to live.

In the case of evil souls, who would gladly return to the material plane instead of suffering eternal damnation, it is not the deceased's Willpower that's resisting, but that of the demon, devil, and so forth, placed in charge of their punishment, their tormentor. In this case, the caster must overcome the tormentor's Willpower. If this is unknown, assume it is at least 20 points higher than that of the deceased to represent that the stronger the soul's will, the more powerful the being placed in charge of his or her damnation. If the caster succeeds, they have successfully anchored the spirit to the host, while a Failed roll results in the victim being either unwilling or unable to return.

If the casting is successful, a fully formed adult body appears in 1d6x10 minutes containing the consciousness of the deceased. The caster has no control of the form or sex in which the soul returns, although the former character Class and Rank is retained. This means it may take some convincing on the part of the character that they are who they say they are when dealing with friends, family, and former acquaintances; and includes their order or guild when it comes time for Advancement if relevant. This is best represented by Influence rolls on the part of the character, modified by how drastic the change, as determined by the Games Master. For example, a dwarf reincarnated into another dwarf may require a Standard Influence roll to convince a former ally of their actual identity, while being reincarnated into a gnome or halfling could result in the roll being one grade more difficult. Finally, that same character could find it two grades more difficult convincing others of their identity if changed into something as extreme as a goblin, orc, or troll.

All Characteristics are determined randomly as per the new form, apart from INT, POW, and CHA, which remain unchanged. Recalculate the character's Base skill levels and adjust the skill totals accordingly. Passions are unaffected. Any former racial Abilities are lost and replaced with those of the new species. If the new form is unsuited to the old character Class, the only option is to deal with it, or learn a new Class. The reincarnated individual remembers most of their former life, though the Games Master may ask for the character to make a Willpower roll to remember significant facts for the first week. A Wish can return the reincarnated individual back to their previous form if later desired.

Roll on the following table to determine the new form.

| **D100** | **Reincarnation Result** |
| --- | --- |
| 01-20 | Human |
| 21-60 | Demi-Human |
|
 | 01-20: Dwarf |

## Remove Curse (Bestow Curse)

(Abjuration)

| **Rank** : Clr 2, Mag 3 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : ?? | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additiona Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : NA |

This spell typically removes the effects of any curse afflicting a creature or item. It does not remove the cursed nature of an item such as a weapon, shield, or armor, but does allow a creature afflicted with such an item to be rid of it. Some curses may only be removed if the spell is cast at a certain Intensity, typically noted in the specific write-up. Either Cure Disease or Remove Curse may be used to cure lycanthropy, with either requiring an Intensity of 12.

The reverse of this spell, Bestow Curse, inflicts one of the following effects on an enemy with a Duration of 30 minutes per Intensity. The victim is allowed an Opposed Willpower roll to resist as normal. Roll 1d100 to determine the nature of the curse inflicted:

- 01-25: All skills using STR, DEX, or CON are one grade more difficult. Initiative -4, Damage Modifier reduced 2 steps.
- 26-50: All skills using INT, POW, or CHA are one grade more difficult. Initiative -4.
- 51-75: Combat Skills and Resistance rolls are 2 grades more difficult.
- 76-00: All Failed skill rolls are treated as Fumbles.

## Remove Fear (Cause Fear)

(Abjuration (Charm))

| **Rank** : Clr 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Charm | **Duration** : See Below |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 30 ft |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : See Below |

The caster of this spell may banish the effects of fear from one individual per Intensity, granting them an additional roll to resist. Remove Fear may also divinely ward against fear for 10 minutes when cast on someone not yet suffering its effects. In both cases, the Resistance roll required of the subject is one grade easier. While the cleric could cast this spell on themselves to ward against fear, they would not be able to cast it to remove any ongoing effects of fear that would prevent the casting of spells.

The reverse of this spell, Cause Fear, requires touching the victim in combat. Those that Fail a Willpower Resistance roll flee in terror at a Sprint for 1d4 Rounds. The direction must be away from the caster of the spell. Cause Fear may be countered by Remove Fear and vice versa.

## Repair

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Clr1, Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : ?? | **Duration** : 24 Hours |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Items or 1 Broken Item | **Resist** : NA |

Repair fixes physical damage to an inanimate object. Each separate successful casting repairs 1d3 Hit Points of damage.

Resurrection (Destruction)

(Necromancy)

| **Rank** : Clr 5 | **Casting Time** : 10 Minutes |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Necromantic | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity, +2 EXP | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : NA (Willpower (Formidable)) |

Resurrection raises any creature dead for no more than 20 years per level of Intensity. The creature is not only given life, but restored to full strength and healed from injury, even restoring lost limbs. Little of the actual creature needs to remain for the spell to still be effective. For example, Resurrection could be used to bring a being back from the dead after 145 years, even if possessing nothing more than a finger bone, assuming the spell is cast at 8 Intensity. The raised individual requires no period of rest and is fully functional immediately. The spell has no effect on a creature that died of natural cause at the end of it allotted lifespan.

If the subject's Alignment was anything other than evil, they can resist the spell with an Opposed Willpower roll and, if successful, negate the effects. This is because the soul or spirit of the deceased is rarely willing to return to the living once it has reached its eternal reward. However, the Games Master may decide to waive the roll if the recipient has unfinished business, cannot be separated from their true love, or has some other heroic reason to live. In the case of evil souls, who would gladly return instead of suffering eternal damnation, it isn't the deceased's Willpower that's resisting, but that of the demon, devil, and so forth, placed in charge of their punishment, their tormentor. In this case, the caster must overcome the tormentor's Willpower. If this is unknown, assume it is at least 20 points higher than that of the deceased to represent that the stronger the soul's will, the more powerful the being placed in charge of his or her damnation. If the caster succeeds, the subject has been successfully resurrected, while a Failed roll results in the victim being either unwilling or unable to return.

Resurrection is very draining, Aging the cleric 3% of their typical lifespan (3 years in the case of a human caster). See Aging, page XX.

When reversed, Destruction, may be used to kill one victim in contact with the cleric at the time of the casting. This victim is allowed a Willpower roll to resist, modified by the target's Rank or SIZ, whichever gives the victim the more beneficial result, as detailed on the following table.

| **Target Rank** | **Target SIZ** | **Willpower Modifier** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0-1\* | 1-20 | Formidable |
| 2 | 21-40 | Hard |
| 3 | 41-60 | Standard |
| 4 | 61-80 | Easy |
| 5 | 81+ | Very Easy |

\* This category includes characters that do not possess a Class.

If this Resistance roll is unsuccessful, the subject is slain outright, their body being turned to dust. Only the casting of Wish will bring the victim back at this stage. On a successful roll, the subject is still reduced to negative 1d4 Hit Points in the touched Hit Location. Armor offers no protection from this damage. Destruction does not age the caster when used.

## Restoration

(Necromancy)

| **Rank** : Clr 3 | **Casting Time** : 3 Minutes |

| **Sphere** : Healing | **Duration** : Permanent |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : NA |

When cast, a victim previously drained of their life force using Energy Drain or similar effects regains one previously lost level of Fatigue. At 1 level of Intensity, this spell only works on a creature drained within the last 24 Hours. Each additional Intensity increases the time that can have passed by a further 24 Hours. For example, a victim previously drained just under 48 hours ago would need the spell cast at 2 Intensity to work. Multiple levels of drained Fatigue require additional castings of Restoration. Regardless of Duration and in addition to any Fatigue restored, this spell also restores all mental capacities, such as those lost through magic or any form of insanity or dementia. Restoration may also be used to remove years lost due to artificial aging, such as that from certain spells. For the spell to be cast in this way, in addition to the normal casting cost, the cleric must expend 1 EXP Roll for each 1% of the recipient's typical lifespan to be restored (1 year for a human). The spell may not reduce the subject's current age below that of their actual age.

## Secure Portal

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 1 Minute/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : 60 ft/Intensity |
| **Area** : 1 Portal | **Resist** : NA |

This spell may be cast to hold shut one door, portcullis, gate, or other similar aperture of wood, stone, or metal as if securely locked. The door, which may be up to 25 Hit Points per Intensity, may be battered down but will not otherwise open for the Duration of the spell, which may be ended by the caster at any time. The spell may be negated with the successful casting of Dispel Magic at an Intensity greater than the Magnitude or Knock at any Intensity. Secure Portal is also automatically bypassed by creatures from beyond the prime material plane such as demons, devils, angels, and elementals since they can pass through solid material. This will also not affect Blink or other such spells.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 1 min.; 60-foot Range; up to 25 hp portal; a typical wooden door |
| 2 | 2 | 2 min.; 120-foot Range; up to 50 hp portal; a wooden reinforced door |
| 3 | 3 | 3 min.; 180-foot Range; up to 75 hp portal; an iron door or portcullis |
| 4 | 4 | 4 min.; 240-foot Range; up to 120 hp portal; a small castle gate |
| 5 | 5 | 5 min.; 300-foot Range; up to 150 hp portal; a large, reinforced castle gate |

## Shield

(Evocation)

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 5 Rounds/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : Caster | **Resist** : NA |

Shieldcreates an invisible mobile disk of force that hovers in front of the magic-user, increasing the difficulty of attacks striking from that direction by deflecting them away. In miniatures combat, Shield will only block damage that passes through one of the caster's front squares. The magic-user does not have to make any kind of skill test beyond the casting of the spell, as the spell's magic automatically interposes the shield between the attacks and the caster. The penalty applied to attacks that strike through the caster's front facing, is based on the attack type, and detailed in the following table.

| **Type of Attack** | **Examples** | **Difficulty to Strike Caster** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Magic missile | Magic Missiles only | Impossible, Magic Missiles are automatically blocked |
| Hurled attacks | Rocks, thrown axes and spears, and so forth | Herculean |
| Device propelled attacks | Arrows, crossbow and manticore bolts, sling stones and bullets, and so forth | Formidable |
| Other physical | Swords, bites, claws, and so on | Hard |
| Spells that may be Evaded | Fire ball, lightning bolt, cone of cold, and so on | Normal difficulty, but no damage if caster evades and half if they fail |

## Silence

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Clr 2 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Guardian | **Duration** : See Below |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 360 ft |
| **Area** : 15 ft. Radius | **Resist** : See Below |

This spell allows the caster to create complete and utter silence in the Area of Effect. No sound whatsoever is possible, conversations cease, spells with a verbal component cannot be cast, and so forth. If Silence is cast on an object or creature, the spell's Area of Effect will move along with the target. However, the same spell cast into open air will remain immobile. The spell's Duration depends on whether the subject is willing or unwilling. On a willing target, the Duration is 2 Minutes/Intensity, while an on unwilling target the Duration is 2 Rounds/Intensity. A Willpower Resistance roll is allowed only if the spell is cast on an unwilling creature and if successful, the spell instead targets the area the creature occupies, remaining immobile.

## Sleep

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 5 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 60 ft |
| **Area** : 10 ft. Radius | **Resist** : Willpower |

This spell causes a magical slumber to fall upon one living creature per level of Intensity in a circular area 10 feet in radius. The spell's Area of Effect is centered at a point in space or on the ground and the closest creature can resist first, then the next closest, and so forth. Where two or more fall at equal distance, randomly determine who is affected. Each creature is allowed a roll to resist and if one is successful, another must try until a total have been slept equal to the spell's Intensity, or no more creatures occupy the Area of Effect. Creatures in a heightened state of alertness, or in combat when the spell is cast, find the roll to resist one grade easier.

Large creatures (SIZ 21-40) are less susceptible to Sleep, with the resistance roll being Easy, while the Resistance roll for Huge creatures (SIZ 41+) is Very Easy. Smaller creatures are always affected before larger ones; therefore, creatures of SIZ 20 or less are always affected before those of SIZ 21 to 40, which are themselves always affected before those of SIZ 41+.

While sleeping, affected creatures are helpless and normal noise will not faze them, but they can be shaken or slapped awake. Any attack, assuming it is not fatal, will also cause them to awaken (though the attack will come as a Surprise). Attempting to awaken a creature takes 1 Combat Round.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 5 min. Duration; 1 creature |
| 2 | 4 | 10 min. Duration; 2 creatures |
| 3 | 5 | 15 min. Duration; 3 creatures |
| 4 | 6 | 20 min. Duration; 4 creatures |

## Slow

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 2 Rounds/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3/Intensity | **Range** : 100 ft |
| **Area** : 20 ft. Radius | **Resist** : Willpower |

This spell allows the caster to halve the normal Movement Rate of one creature. An additional creature may be slowed for each additional level of Intensity. Those affected must be within the Area of Effect when the spell is first, cast but may move freely thereafter. In addition, those under the effects of Slow receive a -4 penalty to their Initiative for the spell's Duration and must reduce their total Action Points by half, including any used for Reactive purposes only. The casting of Slow cancels out the effects of Haste. Slow does not stack with itself or similar magical effects.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 2 Round Duration; 1 creature |
| 2 | 6 | 4 Round Duration; 2 creatures |
| 3 | 9 | 6 Round Duration; 3 creatures |
| 4 | 12 | 8 Round Duration; 4 creatures |
| Continue progression |

## Slow Poison

(Necromancy)

| **Rank** : Clr 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Healing | **Duration** : 1 Hour/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : NA |

This spell allows the caster to slow the effects of poisons and venom; it does not, however, neutralize the toxin. Instead, the toxins spreading through the body are slowed enough that hopefully additional curative measures can be found. A toxin's Onset Time does not kick in until after the spell's Duration has expired.

For example, cobra venom possesses an Onset Time as follows: agony after 1d6+4 minutes, and Asphyxiation after 1d6+6 hours. A single Intensity of Slow Poison therefore postpones the Onset Time by 1 hour, after which, 1d6+4 minutes later, agony sets in as normal.

If Slow Poison is cast on a victim after symptoms have set in, they cease until after the spell's Duration expires and then continue as normal.

As a last resort, if the caster can get to an individual that has 'died' of poisoning within 10 minutes, Slow Poison delays the death of a victim for 1 hour per Intensity, during which the victim remains in a coma. If during this time, the victim can be cured of the poison the victim may yet live and be revived by First Aid or magical healing.

## Speak with Monsters

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Clr 4 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Divination | **Duration** : 2 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 100 ft |
| **Area** : 1 or more Monsters | **Resist** : NA |

This spell allows the caster to understand and be understood by any type of creature capable of any form of communication (telepathic, pheromones, tactile, and so on). The caster simply speaks in their own language and the creature understands the caster's intent or query in its own form of communication. The Games Master should determine the creature's reaction based on its Alignment as compared with that of the caster. The caster may switch from one creature to another of the same type throughout the spell's Duration.

## Sphere of Invulnerability, Lesser

(Abjuration)

| **Rank** : Mag 3 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 1 Round/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : 5 ft. Radius | **Resist** : NA |

When this spell is cast, an immobile sphere of shimmering magical protection forms around the caster. Rank 1 and 2 spells, as well as any magical areas of effect they produce, will fail to penetrate the sphere, including those possessed by magical items or the innate magical Abilities of some creatures. The caster and any spell-capable allies may launch a magical attack from within the sphere with no adverse effects, and even leave the sphere and return without affecting its Duration. Lesser Sphere of Invulnerability is affected normally by Dispel Magic.

## Spider Climb

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 2 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 1/Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : NA |

The subject of this spell can move along vertical surfaces and ceilings with a 10-foot Movement Rate, even while hanging upside down. The subject must remove all hand and footwear and using objects of negligible ENC (ENC less than 1) is impossible due to them sticking to their hands. This includes most spell-casting material components, typically making spell casting impossible while under the influence of Spider Climb. To pull an object free from the individual or pull a resisting individual free from a surface requires a successful Brawn roll at Formidable difficulty.

## Spiritshield

(Abjuration)

| **Rank** : Clr 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Necromantic | **Duration** : Concentration |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : Willpower |

This spell creates a shield around the recipient that deters spirits and ghosts from entering. Any spirit or ghost wishing to attack or possess the recipient must overcome the spell by winning an Opposed Test of their Willpower vs. the caster's Piety skill.

## Spiritual Hammer

(Invocation)

| **Rank** : Clr 2 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Combat | **Duration** : 3 Rounds/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : 30 ft. Radius/Intensity | **Resist** : Parry or Evade |

Upon casting this spell, a hammer-like force of spiritual energy appears, which then hurls itself at a target designated by the caster. Each Turn, the caster may use one of their Action Points to direct the hammer to attack, provided Concentration is maintained. While concentrating, the caster is limited to moving no faster than a walk, and may Evade or Parry with an equipped weapon or shield without breaking concentrating. With each Action Point spent to manipulate the hammer, it can be moved to any location within the caster's field of vision. If the caster is behind an opponent, they may use the hammer to strike the opponent from behind, negating their chance to defend themselves to the best of their ability. Spiritual Hammer causes damage as a normal war hammer (1d8+1), and has a chance to hit equal to the cleric's Combat Skill. Worn armor offers only half protection, but magical Armor Points or a creature's natural armor reduce damage as normal. It may be parried or evaded as normal and attacks against it are ineffective. Spiritual Hammer counts as a magical weapon with regards to striking creatures only harmed by magic, with every 2 levels of Intensity after the first granting the equivalent of a cumulative +1 Magic Bonus, to a Maximum of +5. This bonus does not add to the damage inflicted, rather, it helps damage creatures only harmed by a certain magic bonus or higher.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 | 3 Rounds; 30 ft. radius; counts as +0 |
| 2 | 4 | 6 Rounds; 60 ft. radius; counts as +1 |
| 3 | 5 | 9 Rounds; 90 ft. radius; counts as +2 |
| 4 | 6 | 12 Rounds; 120 ft. radius; counts as +3 |
| 5 | 7 | 15 Rounds; 150 ft. radius; counts as +4 |
| 6 | 8 | 18 Rounds; 180 ft. radius; counts as +5 max |
| Continue progression for Rounds and radius |

## Sun Ray

(Evocation, Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Clr 5 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Sun | **Duration** : 1d4+1 Rounds |
| **Cost** : 3/Intensity | **Range** : 30 ft/Intensity |
| **Area** : 5 ft. Radius | **Resist** : See Below |

When cast, the cleric may summon a brilliant beam of holy light using a Cast Magic Action at any point during the spell's Duration. The beam is natural sunlight and has a five-foot radius. Those in the Area of Effect must Evade to attempt to shield their eyes or become blinded for 1d3 Minutes. If they fail their Resistance roll, the Sun Ray blinds creatures using Dark Vision for 2d4 Minutes and they lose their Dark Vision capability for 1d4+1 Minutes out to 20 feet beyond the Area of Effect. Creatures that find natural sunlight harmful to their vision are blinded permanently on a Failed Resistance roll or blinded for 2d6 Rounds if the roll is successful.

Undead in the Area of Effect take 2d6 points of damage to each Hit Location. Armor, natural or otherwise, offers no protection, but magical Armor Points reduce damage as normal. Those within five feet of the edge of the Area of Effect may Evade to take no damage. Undead within 20 feet of the Area of Effect still take 1d6+1 points of damage but suffer no damage on a successful Resistance roll. Undead specifically harmed by sunlight, such as vampires, are destroyed if they fail to Evade. Fungoid creatures as well as all forms of subterranean fungi suffer the same effects as undead but cannot make a Resistance roll.

## Tidy

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Mag 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : Instant |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : 20 ft |
| **Area** : See Below | **Resist** : NA |

Tidy immediately restores a number of items (up to the caster's POW) equal in size to no more than 2 'Things' each, to a neat, tidy, and orderly fashion within the spell's Range. Items larger than 2 'Things' each are shifted to a more orderly position but will require manual intervention to tidy properly.

## True Seeing

(Divination)

| **Rank** : Clr 3, Mag 4 | **Casting Time** : 1 Round |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Divination | **Duration** : 1 Minute/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : NA |

True Seeing grants the subject the capacity to see the world clearly, to a Range of 60 feet, subject to line of sight. All secrets within the Area of Effect become apparent; both natural and magical darkness is penetrated; secret doors become visible; invisible or ethereal attackers are revealed; illusions and phantasms become obvious; and the true form of shape-changed creatures is revealed. Even the ethereal and other planes adjacent to the material plane can be glimpsed with Concentration. True Seeing also negates the effects of spells such as Blur and Mirror Image. In addition to mundane material components, casting True Seeing requires rare ingredients made from powdered mushrooms, saffron, and animal fat, with a value of at least 300 GP.

## Voice

(Enchantment (Charm))

| **Rank** : Clr 0 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Charm | **Duration** : Concentration |
| **Cost** : 1 | **Range** : See Below |
| **Area** : 1 Target | **Resist** : Willpower |

Voice amplifies the recipient's intonation and delivery so that it becomes compelling when issuing verbal commands. All who can

hear the speaker are forced to listen. Their vocalization also carries across and through even the loudest background noise (howling gales, the roar of a waterfall, the clash of arms on a battlefield) up to a Range of 30 times the recipient's CHA in feet.

## Wall of Fire/Circle of Fire

(Evocation)

| **Rank** : Clr 3, Mag 3 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : ?? | **Duration** : See Below |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : See Below |
| **Area** : See Below | **Resist** : See Below |

This spell allows the caster to conjure forth a wall or circle of blazing flame, as desired at the time of casting, burning a purple or a reddish blue in color. The spell's Duration remains in effect if Concentration is maintained, or for 1 Round per Intensity once Concentration ceases. The specifics are detailed below according to type:

Wall of Fire: This version of the spell creates a stationary wall of fire 20 ft. long per Intensity. Regardless of final Intensity the wall has a height of 10 to 20 ft. as desired when cast. Wall of Fire has a Range of 180 ft. and may not be conjured horizontally.

Circle of Fire: This version of the spell creates a circle of fire around the caster that moves with them. It has a radius of 10 ft., plus another 5 ft. per additional Intensity beyond the first. Regardless of final Intensity the circle has a height of 10 to 20 ft. as desired when cast. Circle of Fire must encircle the caster and has a Range of 0.

The side of the wall or circle facing away from the caster emits scorching heat, causing 1d6 damage per Round to all within 10 ft., and 1d4 damage out to 20 ft. This damage is typically applied at the end of the Round before proceeding to the next. Where a victim occupies both heat zones in a single Round, the greater damage applies. Those leaping through the flame are subjected to 2d6 points of damage, plus an additional point of damage per Intensity beyond the first. This damage is applied to each Hit Location and worn armor offers no protection, but magical Armor Points or a creature's natural armor reduce damage as normal. A successful Evade Resistance roll allows the victim to suffer no damage on the Round the spell springs into being, as the victim attempts to dive away from the heat or past the flames. Fire-using creatures take half this damage and cold-using creatures double. The flames have a chance of igniting flammable materials equal to the damage rolled x5%. See 'Fires' on page XX for additional information.

## Water Breathing (Air Breathing)

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Clr 2, Mag 2 | **Casting Time** : 2 Actions |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : Elemental (Water, Air) | **Duration** : 6 hours/Intensity, +1d4 Hours |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : Touch |
| **Area** : 1 or more Targets | **Resist** : NA |

This spell imparts the ability for the caster or others to breathe water throughout its Duration. While being cast, more than one recipient may be touched and therefore gain the benefits of Water Breathing. In this case, the Duration is divided by the number of subjects. The exact Duration of the Water Breathing spell is unpredictable, and should be rolled by the Games Master, as those under its effects should not know specifically how much time is left. The reverse of this spell, Air Breathing, allows a creature otherwise unable to breathe oxygen to do so. The capability to breathe one's natural element is still retained regardless of the variant of the spell, so a fish could both breathe on land and under the water during the Duration of the spell.

| **Int** | **Cost** | **Variable Effect** |

| 1 | 3 | 6 hours +1d4 hours total |
| 2 | 4 | 12 hours +1d4 hours total |

## Web

(Evocation)

| **Rank** : Mag 1 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Sphere** : None | **Duration** : 20 Minutes/Intensity |
| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 30 ft/Intensity |
| **Area** : 20 ft. Radius | **Resist** : Evade, plus See Below |

This spell causes long strands of sticky webbing to shoot from the caster's hand, which may be anchored floor to ceiling, or wall to wall, to block a passage or impede progress. It may also be sprayed directly onto opponents to entangle them.

Assuming the target has room to escape the webs, a successful Evade roll places the target outside the Area of Effect; however, this requires an Action Point to be available. A Failed resistance roll leaves the victim immobilized, and 1d3 Hit Locations entangled. Like the Entangle Special Effect (see page XX), a webbed location is unusable. An entangled arm cannot use whatever it is holding, a snared chest, abdomen, or leg makes all physical skill rolls one grade harder (Except Brawn rolls used to try to break free), and an enmeshed head causes suffocation as detailed under Asphyxiation on page XX.

On the following Turn, the victim may spend an Action Point to attempt to break free of the webbing. Magic webbing is incredibly strong and sticky, possessing 6 Armor Points and Hit Points equal to 3x the spell's Intensity. Attempting to break free requires the victim to win an Opposed Roll of Brawn against the web's Stickiness (equal to the caster's Arcane Casting skill). If this fails, the target remains fastened, unable to break free by strength alone. Attempting to cut free exposes the tool or weapon used to the same process. Despite popular belief, webs are not flammable, but a character might slowly burn a way through a web by using a flame to shrivel the strands (fire damage ignores the Web's Armor Points).

Wish can change reality in a permanent and significant way. To cast this spell, the magic-user must spend 3 Magic Points and 1 or more EXP rolls depending on the desired results. Each successive casting of Wish in a 1-Month span doubles the expenditure of EXP required normally. The Casting Time is typically required to verbally detail the specifics of the Wish. Upon completion, the caster suffers a loss of Fatigue equal to the EXP expended and ages 5% of their normal life expectancy (for humans, that would be five years). See Age on page XX for the average life expectancies of the demi-human races.

The results of a Wish should be taken literally and are open to interpretation by the Games Master. Greedy desires typically end badly. There is a 10% chance that a Wish made with greedy intentions backfires in some way. For example, wishing for wealth could teleport it from the treasure vaults of the local lord or king. A Wish cannot cancel decrees of deity-like entities unless such a being issued said Wish.

Some example Wishes and the required EXP expenditure follow.

| Create permanent, nonmagical coin, objects, or property with a value of no more than 10,000 GP. | 2 EXP |
| Create permanent, nonmagical coin, objects, or property with a value of no more than 50,000 GP. | 3 EXP |

\* In addition to any EXP requirement of the duplicated effects.

\*\* Each successive increase or decrease costs 1 cumulative EXP Roll: 1 EXP for the first, 2 EXP for the second, 3 EXP for the third, 4 EXP for the fourth, and 5 EXP for the fifth. This applies even in the case of a different magic-user casting Wish.

\*\*\* This requires a Willpower vs. Willpower Resistance roll against that of the intended victim. Failure means the Wish still succeeds, though as a twisted interpretation of the wisher's desires. For example, the caster could be transported to the future where the victim is already dead, but so are all the wisher's friends and loved ones.

This spell creates a small invisible 'eye' that the magic-user may see through for the Duration of the spell. This eye may be moved ahead of the party or sent to look around corners and into rooms having a Movement Rate of 20 ft. per Round (240 ft. per minute), if only scanning for 'obvious' threats or items of interest. This will typically only extend to the floor and lower walls. If attempting to be more thorough (examining the full walls and ceiling as well), its Movement Rate is reduced to 10 ft. per Round (120 feet per minute). The Games Master should feel free to allow Perception rolls on the part of the caster, where necessary, with regards to spotting visual anomalies. The eye is corporeal, unable to pass through solid matter, and possesses normal vision out to 60 ft, and Infravision out to 10 ft. The caster must maintain Concentration on the eye throughout the Duration, or it will remain inert until Concentration is once again established. Any gaze attacks that would normally affect the caster still affect the caster as normal; however, the eye is considered independent of the caster with respect to blindness, darkness spells, and so forth. For the purposes of fitting through small openings, the eye is no bigger than 1 inch, and has a SIZ of 1.

## Word of Recall

(Transmutation)

| **Rank** : Clr 4 | **Casting Time** : 1 Action |

| **Cost** : 3, +1/additional Intensity | **Range** : 0 |
| **Area** : The caster | **Resist** : NA |

When this spell is cast, the cleric is instantly teleported to a pre-designated sanctuary, and a designated arrival point no larger than 10-foot radii. There is no limit to the actual Range teleported, including between multiple planes. Within a single plane, there is no chance of a mishap, however, crossing even one plane gives a Fumble chance of 91-00%, two planes give a Fumble on a roll of 81-00%, and so on. This replaces the caster's normal Fumble chance. A Fumble when crossing planes signifies that the cleric is irrevocably lost. Fumbles within a single plane follow the normal rules.

In addition to themselves and any carried equipment, the cleric may transport another 3 SIZ/9 'Things' per Intensity. The additional material transported may be treasure, equipment, or living beings. However, transported creatures must have the spell cast at a sufficient level of Intensity to cover any carried equipment.

## Notes on Monster Rank

Rank denotes an approximate challenge of the creature in question and is similar, but _not_ equal to, a character's Rank. Four Rank 1 creatures would be a challenge for four Rank 1 characters. It doesn't mean it will be an equal fight, just that it should be a challenge. For example, a party of six Rank 1 characters should find six Rank 1 monsters a challenge, or twelve Rank ½, or three Rank 2, or a single Rank 6, and so on. That doesn't mean that they couldn't survive a battle against a Rank 8 monster, or that they couldn't be destroyed by a number of creatures equaling half their Rank. That's just the nature of random dice rolls. It does, however, give a starting point for Games Masters learning the system. **A good rule of thumb is to choose monsters whose Rank is equal to the party's Rank, plus or minus one**. That way the players aren't always running into the same number of orcs, goblins, ogres, and so on.

## Creature Abilities

A creature ability is something it can do naturally because of its physiology, biology, innate magic, and so forth. Birds, for example, can flap through the air, and so Flying is an ability.

Each of the following abilities is described in terms of its game effects, and how it may affect interactions with others. Not all these Abilities are on display in the Sample Creatures provided later, but they show how seemingly mundane creatures can be turned into something unique, challenging, or downright terrifying. As a rule of thumb, creatures should have up to three Abilities that are applicable to their nature and environment. A demonic spider, for example, might have Adhering, Demon, Grappler and Vampiric.

#### Adhering

The creature can move freely on vertical surfaces, and even move upside down on a ceiling with no special equipment. Such Movement is always at half the creature's normal Movement rate.

#### Aquatic

The creature breathes water rather than air, generally possessing gills or a skin capable of absorbing dissolved air directly. If taken out of water and their breathing organs allowed to dry out, they begin to suffocate after their CON in minutes if remaining passive or half that time if moving or fighting.

#### Blood Sense

Allows the creature to detect blood over great distances, either carried by wind or water. Traces of blood can be sensed at a distance of half its INS in miles.

#### Breathe Flame

The creature breathes flame over an area as a Combat Action. The flame covers a cone in front of the creature, which stretches for its CON x5 feet. At the furthest extent, the width of the cone is equal to its length. Any creature caught in the flame suffers fire-based damage to all hit locations, though a character can attempt to Evade to halve this damage. Armor Points count as normal unless otherwise noted.

A creature can only breathe flame once in a specified time period (usually once per hour or once per day). Further attempts to breathe flame within this time require the creature to pass Endurance rolls with each roll becoming one grade harder or suffer a level of Fatigue.

#### Burrower

The creature is adept at tunnelling through the ground at its normal Movement rate. Some creatures are limited in the kind of ground they can move through, which is noted in the creature's description.

#### Camouflaged

The creature is adept at hiding due to its coloration or unusual surface texture. Those attempting to spot the creature suffer a penalty to Perception of two difficulty grades.

#### Characteristic Drain

The creature has the innate ability to drain temporary Characteristic points from the target of their attacks. The type of attack, the Characteristic affected, and how to resist the draining effect is detailed in the creature's description.

#### Cold-Blooded

The creature does not need to eat frequently. One meal a week is sufficient to keep it healthy and well fed, and gorging itself on a large amount of meat will remove the need to eat for a month. Conversely, when exposed to temperatures below 60 degrees Fahrenheit, its reflexes become muted, suffering a penalty of -6 to Initiative, and the loss of one Combat Action per round. Below 40 degrees Fahrenheit cold-blooded creatures become completely torpid, entering a helpless catatonic state.

#### Dark Vision

Allows the creature to see normally in the complete absence of light.

#### Death Sense

In tune with the powers of death, the creature can sense the death of living things, and dead flesh at a range of up to half its INT or INS in miles.

#### Disease Immunity

The creature is immune to all diseases. All creatures without SIZ automatically have this ability, although it is not specifically listed in their descriptions.

#### Diving Strike

Some creatures can plummet from the sky or surge through the waters to attack their prey, striking with incredible force. This is effectively charging for creatures which are not land based. Diving Strike increases both the Size of the attack, and the creature's Damage Modifier by one step, for this attack only. A diving strike may only be used once per round. The creature must be at least one full round of Movement above its target (or possibly below if submerged) in order to use the diving strike.

#### Earth Sense

Some creatures are so in tune with the underground world that they can work perfectly well in the total darkness of the deep. By sensing vibration and air pressure, a creature with Earth Sense can fight, and make Perception rolls with no penalty as long as their target is no more than their INS x5 feet away. If using Earth Sense above ground the range is halved.

#### Echolocation

The creature senses its environment through reflections of sonic waves. This means that it can perceive others that may be either motionless or hidden. In such circumstances, using a Stealth roll to attempt to remain unperceived by the creature is two grades more difficult.

#### Engulfing

The creature has an orifice which can swallow targets whole. The maximum size of an engulfed victim is figured as half the creature's own SIZ but may be less than this depending on the creature's physiology. When engulfed the victim suffers at least one damage roll based on the creature's bite attack before being swallowed – the time spent chewing depends on the creature, and how sensitive its innards are. If still alive a swallowed victim will begin to suffocate, likely dying by asphyxiation before suffering any noticeable damage from stomach acid. Realistically, an engulfed victim lacks the mobility to move inside the digestive tract or the creature is so large that he will die long before he can cut its way out.

#### Flying

The creature automatically succeeds in everyday moving and maneuvering whilst flying and need not roll their Fly skill unless attempting an unusually difficult task, such as flying against a powerful wind, evading a ranged attack in the air, or out-maneuvering an aerial foe. A flyer may substitute the Fly skill (base STR+DEX) for Evade whilst fighting whilst aloft.

#### Formidable Natural Weapons

This creature can actively parry or deflect attacks using its natural weapons. This is due to a combination of fighting style and possessing natural armament being formed from resilient substances such as horn, chitin or bone which can shrug off damage from manufactured weapons. Note that creatures lacking this trait either rely on their natural armor to turn blows or use Evade.

#### Frenzy

When wounded or exposed to a particular substance - blood for instance - the creature must succeed in a Willpower roll or enter a frenzy. The frenzy lasts a number of rounds equal to the creature's CON. During the frenzy they must only spend Combat Actions on attacking or moving towards combat. Spellcasting, parrying, evading, and anything else is forbidden; all thoughts of self-preservation washed away in a red haze. In return, the creature no longer suffers pain or fatigue, and is impervious to mental control. During this time, it is immune to all the detrimental effects of Serious Wounds, although a Major Wound will still incapacitate. If still alive, once the frenzy finishes the creature automatically gains a fatigue level of Exhausted.

#### Gaze Attack

The creature has a gaze attack. This attack may be active (the creature must consciously spend an Action Point on its turn to use it on a foe) or passive (anyone looking at the creature is affected), as listed in the creature's description.

#### Grappler

If the creature successfully strikes in combat, it can immediately Grapple in addition to inflicting damage. If the creature's attack was parried (or the creature itself is parrying), then the creature is granted the Grip effect against the opponent's limb or the Pin Weapon effect against his weapon instead. The creature always uses its Brawn skill to resist a victim from breaking free.

#### Hold Breath

The creature can hold its breath for extended periods of time. If prepared and remaining fairly static, the creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to its CON. This period is halved if the creature is active, such as when swimming or fighting.

#### Immunity

The creature is completely immune to damage caused by one type of source. This source (cold, fire, iron, etc.) will be noted in the creature's listing, but a narrative description may be necessary for some of the more specific immunities.

#### Intimidate

The creature may intimidate opponents as a prelude to combat or to avoid it altogether: growls, snarls, lowering of horns, and so forth. Opponents must make an unopposed Willpower roll to hold their ground; a success allows a character to stand his ground, whereas a failure indicates that they must spend the next round instinctively placing distance between themselves and the creature. If he fumbles the Willpower roll, then the character flees at maximum speed. A critical success allows the character to ignore any further intimidation attempts by the creature or its brethren during that encounter. The effect continues for as long as the creature continues to act in a threatening manner, which includes it making an attack.

#### Leaper

The creature uses Leaping attacks as described on page XX of the Combat chapter but can combine the leap with a physical attack such as a claw or bite. If the leaping creature wins the opposed leap attack roll, it automatically inflicts damage for one of its natural weapons on the target. This damage cannot be parried except by Passive Blocking.

#### Life Sense

In tune with the rhythms of nature, this creature can determine the vitality of any living creature by touch alone. If the creature makes a successful Perception roll, it learns of the target's current injuries, Fatigue level, and whether it is currently afflicted by any poison or disease. The creature is also aware of any form of life within a number of feet equal to three times its Willpower skill, which may make Stealth difficult to accomplish.

#### Light Sensitive

Those suffering light sensitivity find all skill rolls in daylight one Difficulty Grade more difficult.

#### Magic Sense

Like Life Sense but permits the creature to detect magical emanations over the same distances. If the creature touches another and makes a successful Perception roll, it learns of the target's current magic points, carried enchantments, and active spells.

#### Multi-Headed

The creature gains an additional Combat Action per extra head possessed beyond the first. These are lost as each individual head is incapacitated or severed. Provided one head remains active, the creature can still control its shared body. When a multi-headed creature resists spells which affect emotions or intellect, it rolls individual saves for each still intact head.

#### Multi-Limbed

Similar to Multi-headed, the creature gains an additional Combat Action per extra pair of limbs (beyond the first) it can bring to bear during combat – those normally used to hold up or move the creature do not count. These extra Combat Actions can only be used to perform actions with those specific limbs and are lost as each pair are immobilized or incapacitated.

#### Night Sight

Allows the creature to treat partial darkness as illuminated and darkness as partial darkness.

#### Poison Immunity

The creature is immune to all poisons. All creatures without SIZ automatically have this Trait, although it is not specifically listed in their descriptions.

#### Regeneration

The creature can regenerate Hit Points lost to damage. The speed of regeneration varies depending upon the creature. Unless specifically noted, regeneration does not replace lost limbs, and the severing of a vital location (head, chest, or abdomen) will still result in death.

#### Swimmer

The creature automatically succeeds in everyday moving and maneuvering whilst swimming and need not roll their Swim skill unless attempting an unusually difficult task, such as swimming against a powerful tide or leaping up a waterfall. A swimmer may substitute the Swim skill for Athletics and Evade rolls whilst in water.

#### Terrifying

The creature's appearance, form or aura is so terrifying it forces viewers to make an unopposed Willpower roll. Success indicates the viewer is shaken for one round and cannot act offensively. Failure causes them to flee in terror. A fumble causes the viewer to collapse unconscious from the shock. Only a critical success allows the viewer to act unhindered. The viewer need not make any further checks for the remainder of the combat, even if more of the same creatures are present. Repeated exposure to a specific type of Terrifying monster may eventually permit the skill check to become one or more grades easier.

#### Trample

The creature can trample beings with a SIZ of half or less than its own, using its Athletics skill to attack. This inflicts damage equal to twice the creature's base Damage Modifier and increases the Size of the attack by one step. How and when trample is used depends on the circumstances. If immobile the creature may trample a prone opponent on its turn, but this costs an Action Point. If the trample is performed whilst the creature is moving or charging over an opponent, then the trample is a Free Action.

#### Undead

Being already dead, the creature is immune to the consequences of both fatigue and severe injuries. Undead are thus immune to all the detrimental effects of Serious Wounds. Even Major Wounds do not incapacitate them, although they can still have locations severed or shattered as per normal. Treat the head or chest location of the undead creature as the area where the spirit or magic has been bound. Any location (and those contiguous to it) which is smashed or severed from the bound area ceases to function, but the remainder of the body can continue if it still has limbs with which to act. A Major Wound to the magic-infused location destroys the undead outright. Only fully corporeal dead creatures may possess the Undead trait.

#### Vampiric

The creature drains its victim's blood, causing an increase in Fatigue levels. The creature must use a bite attack, and cause damage with the bite to be able to drain blood at the rate described in the creature's description.

#### Venomous

The creature has a venomous bite, sting, or other means of attack.

#### Wing Buffet

The creature is so large it can damage opponents by beating its wings. This requires an Attack Action and does damage equal to its Damage Modifier to those within 10 feet of its side squares.

## Example Basic Magic Items

This is but a small sample of some of the more common _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ magic items. Those with prices including an \* need to incorporate the cost of the weapon or armor into the total.

### +1 or +2 Amulet of Magica (250 GP or 500 GP)

This amulet provides the wearer with additional Magic Points, which may be drawn from to cast spells. A character may only draw from a single item that provides Magic Points at one time. Spent points do not regenerate naturally and must be provided by a spellcaster, not necessarily the amulet's owner.

### +1 Armor (500 GP\*)

This armor has been enchanted to negate an additional point of damage.

### +1 or +2 Ring of Magica (250 GP or 500 GP)

This ring functions in all ways as an Amulet of Magica as detailed above.

### +1 Ring of Protection (500 GP)

A Ring of Protection provides +1 point of armor while worn. In addition, add a +5% bonus to Resistance rolls. If worn with magical armor, only the bonus provided by the armor applies. The bonus provided to Resistance rolls is not adversely affected, however. A Ring of Protection may be worn with non-magical armor without penalty. Multiple Rings of Protection do not stack, with only the greatest bonus prevailing.

### +5% Shield (250 GP\*)

This shield has been reinforced through magical Enchantment, with a +5% bonus to Combat Skill when Parrying. This shield possesses +5 Armor Points and +2 Hit Points for a shield of its type.

### +5% Shield, +20% vs. Missiles (500 GP\*)

This shield has been reinforced through magical Enchantment, with a +5% bonus to Combat Skill when Parrying a melee attack and +20% when Parrying missiles. This shield possesses +5 Armor Points and +2 Hit Points for a shield of its type.

### +10% Shield (250 GP\*)

This shield has been reinforced through magical Enchantment, with a +10% bonus to Combat Skill when Parrying. This shield possesses +10 Armor Points and +4 Hit Points for a shield of its type.

### +1 Weapon (melee 400 GP\*, ranged 500 GP\*)

This weapon has been enchanted to do +1 damage and possesses +10 Armor Points and +4 Hit Points.

### Bag of Holding (500 GP)

This large cloth sack opens into a pocket dimension, being much bigger on the inside than the outside, and can be used to store much more than could fit normally into a bag of its shape and size. The bag is equal to 2 'Things' in weight regardless of its actual contents and can store up to 100 'Things.' This bag may be carried in another container and still weigh only 2 'Things' even when full.

### Elven Boots (1000 GP)

These soft leather boots modify the wearer's ability to move silently regardless of terrain, even walking across dry leaves or creaky boards producing nothing more noticeable than a soft footstep. The wearer is granted a 95% Sneak skill, unmodified by terrain. The boots grant no further bonus with regards to those with a skill more than 95%, other than allowing them to use their normal skill level without worrying about terrain penalties.

### Potion of Invisibility (50 GP)

When quaffed, this potion grants the imbiber Invisibility for 1d4+2 minutes. Like the spell of the same name (see page XX), any attack made by the beneficiary of its contents instantly causes the subject to reappear. Other non-combat actions made on the part of the imbiber, for example, talking, eating, running, opening doors, and so on, have no effect on the Duration, which is equal to 1d4+2 minutes per dose consumed. A typical potion contains enough for eight doses.

### Potion of Levitation (40 GP)

The imbiber of this potion is granted the capability to levitate vertically at a rate of 10 feet per Round. The imbiber can carry one other person if they are SIZ 20 or less. While the character may not move horizontally under the power of this spell, the character may be able to pull along a wall or cliff at a Base Movement Rate of 10 feet per Round.

### Ring of (Spell), Rank 1 (1,000 GP)

This ring allows the casting of a single spell of Rank 1. No matter the spell, all possess an ongoing Duration, with the spell being cast automatically when the ring is put on and lasting until removed. They are limited in the type of spell, which may be enchanted into them, with the most common being Detect Magic, Endure Heat or Cold, Feather Fall, Floating Disk, Invisibility, Levitation, Protection from Evil (or Good), Slow Poison. Others are possible at the discretion of the Games Master. With regards to the Ring of Invisibility, attacking causes the wearer to become visible for 1d3+1 Rounds.

### Wand of (Spell), Rank 1 (1,000 GP)

This wand possesses a single spell which is typically usable by all characters regardless of Class. There is a 50% chance that a magic wand will contain a magic-user spell, and 50% of a cleric spell. The wand possesses 90 charges, and each use expends a number of charges equal to the spell's normal Casting Cost, irrespective of Intensity. For example, a wand will cast a spell possessing a Casting Cost of '1/Intensity' by expending a single charge, while a spell with a Casting Cost of '3/Intensity' will expend 3 charges. This is irrespective of the spell's actual Intensity as produced by the item. The spell is cast at an Intensity and Magnitude of 3 and costs the wielder no Magic Points. See the relevant spell for additional information.

### Rod of (Spell), Rank 1 (1,500 GP)

Unlike a Wand of Spell, the Rod of Spell contains 60 charges and has an Intensity and Magnitude of 6. However, the rod may only be used by a character of a Class capable of casting the spell.

### Staff of (Spell), Rank 1 (2,000 GP)

A Staff of Spell contains 30 charges and has an Intensity and Magnitude of 9. However, the staff may only be used by a character of a Class capable of casting the spell.

# Appendix: Conversion Tables

## Imperial Weights and Measures to Metric Conversion

To give _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ a cleaner presentation, make it easier to read, and condense descriptions and tables, _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ line will focus on Imperial measurements as opposed to both Imperial and Metric. Imperial was chosen to better facilitate conversion of existing material as most adventures, battlemats, and maps used by other games in the genre utilize the Imperial system. However, for those wishing to use the Metric System, the most commonly used weights and measures have been converted using the following table. Because we are not typically dealing with real-world creatures, spells, and so on, we can grant a little leeway in the weights and measures we've made up for them. Rather than using exact conversions, it is easier to use one that can be easily remembered, thus better facilitating game play.

Wind, especially very strong winds, can have an adverse effect on activity. A wind's Strength (STR) is expressed in miles per hour of velocity. Its effect on physical skills – those involving STR or DEX – is detailed in the Skill column; effects on Movement Rate in the Movement Rate column (for example, a Light Gale of STR 40 reduces human walking speed to two thirds.

Temperate can vary dramatically due to climate, season, and elevation, depending on the campaign world and where scenarios are set. The above table provides a guideline for the effects of extreme temperature on characters.

Wearing suitable clothing permits a character a grace period of their CON in hours before exposure sets in, as shown in the Risk column. After this point they need to seek shelter or start to suffer Fatigue loss. Wet characters shift the Risk Rate one step cooler. Light or moderate gale force winds also shift Risk Rate by one step cooler, whilst strong gales and storms shift it two steps.
